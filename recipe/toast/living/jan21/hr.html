 <h1>Communication</h1>
 <p>There are various methods of communication. This section
 covers a few of the important ones used by the project.</p>
<hr>
 <p>Communication stones seem to come in pairs and have mysterious
 properties:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>They can transfer thoughts in two directions once activated
 if used alone.</li>
 <li>If used with another device, they can transfer one's
 consciousness to another body.</li>
 <li>If both stones are used with another device, the
 consciousnesses switch bodies.</li>
 </ul>
<hr>
 <p>Radios use the electromagnetic spectrum in the meter range and
 longer.</p>
<hr>
 <p>Signal flares use the electromagnetic spectrum in the
 nanometer range.</p>

<p>Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching
time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical
age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading
campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a
supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwearth could be
appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.</p>
<p><i>Maybe it won't be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was
comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night's
shift.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the
astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of
doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a
semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a
thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and
deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the
observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow
of Gralmond's winters.</p>
