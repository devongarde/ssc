<p> Next, you meet a fisher. You can say one of several greetings:
<dl>
<dt> "Hello there!"
<dd>
<p> She responds with "Hello, how may I help you?"; you can respond with:
<dl>
<dt> "I would like to buy a fish."
<dd> <p> She sells you a fish and the conversation finishes.
<dt> "Can I borrow your boat?"
<dd>
<p> She is surprised and asks "What are you offering in return?".
<dl>
<dt> "Five gold." (if you have enough)
<dt> "Ten gold." (if you have enough)
<dt> "Fifteen gold." (if you have enough)
<dd> <p> She lends you her boat. The conversation ends.
<dt> "A fish." (if you have one)<dt> "A newspaper." (if you have one)
<dt> "A pebble." (if you have one)
<dd> <p> "No thanks", she replies. Your conversation options
at this point are the same as they were after asking to borrow
her boat, minus any options you've suggested before.
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt> "Vote for me in the next election!"
<dd> <p> She turns away. The conversation finishes.
<dt> "Madam, are you aware that your fish are running away?"
<dd>
<p> She looks at you skeptically and says "Fish cannot run, miss".
<dl>
<dt> "You got me!"
<dd> <p> The fisher sighs and the conversation ends.
<dt> "Only kidding."
<dd> <p> "Good one!" she retorts. Your conversation options at this
point are the same as those following "Hello there!" above.
<dt> "Oh, then what are they doing?"
<dd> <p> She looks at her fish, giving you an opportunity to steal
her boat, which you do. The conversation ends.

<h1>Dialogue</h1>
<p><small>Some characters repeat their lines in order each time you interact
with them, others randomly pick from amongst their lines. Those who respond in
order have numbered entries in the lists below.</small>
<h2>The Shopkeeper</h2>
<ul>
<li>How may I help you?
<li>Fresh apples!
<li>A loaf of bread for madam?
</ul>
<h2>The pilot</h2>

<ul>
<li>I'm about to fly out, sorry!
<li>Sorry, I'm just waiting for flight clearance and then I'll be off!
</ul>
<p>After the accident:
<ol>
<li>I'm about to fly out, sorry!
<li>Ok, I'm not leaving right now, my plane is being cleaned.
<li>Ok, it's not being cleaned, it needs a minor repair first.
<li>Ok, ok, stop bothering me! Truth is, I had a crash.
</ol>
<h2>Clan Leader</h2>
<p>During the first clan meeting:

<p> Interviewer: Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight
Mr Norman St John Polevaulter, who for the past few years has been
contradicting people. Mr Polevaulter, why <em>do</em> you
contradict people?
<p> Norman: I don't. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup>
<p> Interviewer: You told me you did!

<section>
<p id="fn1"><a href="#r1">[1]</a> This is, naturally, a lie,
but paradoxically if it were true he could not say so without
contradicting the interviewer and thus making it false.</p>

<p> <span class="speaker">Customer</span>: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.

<aside>
<p>In 1970, the British Empire lay in ruins, and foreign
nationalists frequented the streets — many of them Hungarians
(not the streets — the foreign nationals). Sadly, Alexander
Yalt has been publishing incompetently-written phrase books.
