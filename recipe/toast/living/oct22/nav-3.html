<p>You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my
blog</a>, from whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east
you can see a large mountain, upon which many <a
href="/school">school papers</a> are littered. Far up thus mountain
you can spy a little figure who appears to be me, desperately
scribbling a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.</p>
<p>To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled <a
href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more
boring-looking exit is labeled <a
href="https://isp.example.net/">ISP™</a>.</p>
<p>To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts
page</a>. Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you
see a rat run quickly out of the page.</p>
