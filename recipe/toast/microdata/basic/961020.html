The new landlord at my local, the Nag&rsquo;s Head, just isn&rsquo;t fitting in. He&rsquo;s seriously annoyed the locals by insisting on closing at the legal time. In our part of the country, if a pub gets visited by the police after hours, it&rsquo;s because they want a drink. To quote one regular: he got thrown out of the Nag&rsquo;s at eleven fifteen, only to pass the Star and Garter ten minutes away which was clearly open with half&ndash;a&ndash;dozen cars outside, and wondered why he was going home so early.

J doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit in with the social atmosphere either. His wife, W, is better at it, but I got put off when I turned up to an empty Nag&rsquo;s Head a week or so ago to encounter them arguing. Fair enough, couples do that, but to continue arguing, in quite a bitter manner, in front of a regular customer, was embarrassing. I suspect many Nag&rsquo;s drinkers may end up going to another pub.
