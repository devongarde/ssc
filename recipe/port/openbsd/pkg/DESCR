The command line utility ssc is an opinionated HTML nitpicker for
static websites, analysing most versions of HTML, XHTML, SVG, & MathML,
including ontologies. It can produce detailed reports, 'repaired' HTML
with resolved server side includes, site statistics, and more. It is
alpha quality, at best.
