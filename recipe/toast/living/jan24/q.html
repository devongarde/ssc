<p>The man said <q>"Things that are impossible just take
longer"</q>. I disagreed with him.</p>

<p>The W3C page <cite>About W3C</cite> says the W3C's
mission is <q cite="http://www.example.org/Consortium/">"To lead the
World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and
guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web"</q>. I
disagree with this mission.</p>

<p>In <cite>Example One</cite>, he writes <q>"The man
said <q>'Things that are impossible just take longer'</q>. I
disagreed with him"</q>. Well, I disagree even more!</p>

<p>His best argument was ❝I disagree❞, which
I thought was laughable.</p>

<p>The word "ineffable" could have been used to describe the disaster
resulting from the campaign's mismanagement.</p>
