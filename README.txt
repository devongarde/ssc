WARNING: this code is:
- incomplete
- pre-alpha
- IT PROBABLY WON'T BEHAVE AS YOU EXPECT :-)
- do NOT feed it untrusted data



ssc analyses static HTML snippets, files and sites:
- HTML 1.0/+/2.0/3.0/3.2/4.00/4.01/5.0/5.1/5.2/5.3-draft
- HTML living standard, Jan 2005 to Jan 2022
- SVG 1.0/1.1/1.2 Tiny/1.2 Full/2.0/2.x draft Apr 2021
- MathML 1/2/3/4-draft
- XHTML 1.0/1.1/2.0/5.x
- finds broken links (requires curl)
- processes server side includes, mostly
- analyses common microdata & RDFa ontologies

with opinions on:
- standard english where dialect is required
- perfectly legal but sloppy HTML
- abhorrent rudeness such as autoplay on videos

It does NOT:
- behave securely: its parser is holier than robin's cow
- analyse or understand scripts
- analyse or understand styles, beyond nicking class names from CSS
- analyse or understand XML or derivatives except as noted above

It can output:
- 'repaired' HTML (not XHTML)
- HTML with resolved Server Side Includes
- JSON summaries of microformat and microdata content
- website statistical information
- updated website with datafile deduplication


ssc -h
for a usage summary.

ssc -f config_file
analyse site using preprepared configuration

ssc directory
analyse website based in directory



To build & run:
1. Follow the build instructions in build.txt
2. Gleefully run ssc. It will misbehave if you are insufficiently gleeful.



NOTE
SSC can be run in a CGI environment. This is intended for use with OpenBSD's
native httpd web server (https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8). You are reminded
that SSC is pre-alpha software. Do NOT expose it to untrusted data sources,
such as the open web, without taking serious precautions. SSC probably has more
bugs than the Creator's Ultimate All-Beetle Extravaganza (J.B.S. Haldane,
apocryphal : "[the Creator has] an inordinate fondness for beetles.").



Notes on names:
- recipe: a nod to Vernor Vinge's "A Fire Upon the Deep";
- tea: without tea, nothing works; then there's builders' tea;
- sauce: identifies those who presume; and anyway, it's obvious;
- toast: toasts code; i like burnt toast;
- heater: i'm not stopping now;
- unii: my preferred plural of unix: to my ears, both unixes and unices sound
  like they sing castrato.
