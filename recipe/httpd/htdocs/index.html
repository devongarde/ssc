<h2>introduction</h2>

<P>
The static site checker is an opinionated HTML nitpicker, a command&ndash;line tool to validate static HTML &amp; XHTML websites.
I built it to nitpick arts &amp; ego, my hand&ndash;coded
<A href="https://dylanharris.org/">identity website</A>.
</P>

<P>
It should not be used on untrusted content; its parsers are holier than <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Holy...%22">Robin&rsquo;s cow</A>.
</P>

<P>
If you want to try it,
<a href="src/ssc-v0.1.51.tgz" type="application/gzip">here&rsquo;s the current source</a>. The build instructions follow.

<section id="why">
<h2>why SSC</h2>

<p>
Why did I make the static site checker? Aren&rsquo;t there a lot of other HTML validators around?
When I checked a few years ago; I couldn&rsquo;t find a web site validator, only web page validators.
Things may have improved. Anyway, my google foo is poo.
</p>

<p>
My <a href="https://dylanharris.org/">identity website</a> has more than 100,000 pages. I&rsquo;m too impatient
to push each through a validator one by one; I want to validate my site as a whole.
Furthermore, single page validators can&rsquo;t catch inter&ndash;page errors, such as
broken internal links, let alone hidden links
(an otherwise valid link to a HIDDEN element).
</p>

<p>
Many people avoid such problems by using frameworks.
I find frameworks awful. IMAO, they produce dull, boring, trite design.
The visual arts world has had centuries to develop excellent form for a rectangular space.
Most 21<sup>st</sup> frameworks are so crude they haven&rsquo;t even absorbed 14<sup>th</sup> century visual arts&rsquo; ideas,
when painters broke out of rectangular form in a rectangular frame.
So much is possible, so much hasn&rsquo;t happened.
I want to break this dull, stultifying, archaic, mutton.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I&rsquo;m making the wrong comparison, that the web isn&rsquo;t about image, it&rsquo;s about type.
The Western visual arts never did really suss mixing writing and form
(that&rsquo;s not really true, but, IMAO, such arts never escaped their context).
However, the Eastern visual arts most certainly did, and frameworks haven&rsquo;t noticed them either.
</p>

<p>
Enough of this. Rather than criticising other people for not doing, I should do. 
I need to make some example sites. That&rsquo;s where SSC comes in.
</p>

<p>
If I am to build a site using an experimental visual process, I can&rsquo;t use frameworks.
If I can&rsquo;t use frameworks, I have to hand code.
And there&rsquo;s the key problem: HTML is such a convoluted, evolved mess,
that the people who designed it, in their own design presentations, make errors.
Ok, I only found this out by testing SSC on them,
which conveniently illustrates that HTML is overcomplicated.
I&rsquo;m not going
to reveal names because these people are working hard to make the web a better place.
Let&rsquo;s just say <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3</a> had broken links,
<a href="https://whatwg.org/">WhatWG</a> referenced withdrawn ontologies,
and many other authors&rsquo; sites have other internal inconsistencies.
That the people who define the web make mistakes using their own design in their own documents that
espouse their design, helps explain why most stick to dull, formulaic, boring, frameworks.
To be fair, my HTML is far worse than any of these mild examples of technical naughtiness,
which is why I had to write SSC.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve yet to build a site inspired by visual art&rsquo;s form and layout.
My efforts have been spent building SSC, a tool to make that practical.
</p>

<p>
Since I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;ll list other issues I have with frameworks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
They have to be regularly maintained. Every time an update comes out, that update has to be applied to a site,
or the site becomes vulnerable to the exploits published by the update.
Time is lost playing patch catchup.
</li>
<li>
Updates for frameworks sometimes fail;
instead of fixing issues, they break sites.
That&rsquo;s why <a href="https://dylanharris.org/past/aei/2010/index.html">I dropped Drupal</a>.
That&rsquo;s why I swore off NextCloud&mdash;<a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/news/2021/nextbox-your-private-cloud-home-office">to which I returned when
NitroPhone</a> made maintenance <A href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem_Field">an SEP</a>.
</li>
<li>
Frameworks use scripted languages, such as PHP.
There were, in October 2021,
<A href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/128/PHP-PHP.html?vendor_id=74">five known vulnerabilities in PHP</a>
(far better than time was).
Other frameworks use other scripted languages with other problems.
</li>
<li>
IMAO, frameworks&rsquo; and scripts&rsquo; worst flaw is many import code at runtime from
third&ndash;party repositories.
Their integrity and security is dependent on that of the repository,
over which a site owner (usually) has no control.
There are many examples of
<a href="https://www.theallineed.com/technology/20210330/php-source-code-repository-hacked/">repositories being hacked</a>,
breaking the security and integrity of all sites that use them.
</li>
</ul>

&mdash; perfectly legal but sloppy HTML
&mdash; abhorrent rudeness such as autoplay on videos

It does NOT:
&mdash; analyse or understand scripts
&mdash; analyse or understand XML or derivatives, except as noted above

It can output:

ssc directory

To build &amp; run:
1. Follow the build instructions in build.txt
2. Gleefully run ssc. It will misbehave if you are insufficiently gleeful.



This is an alpha version of ssc. It may contain unexpected features.
If you encounter such a delight, please help improve ssc by collecting
the following information (where relevant):
&mdash; version of ssc;
&mdash; precise version of the operating system;
&mdash; hardware architecture and system information;
&mdash; detailed description of the problem;
&mdash; detailed description of the steps to recreate it;
&mdash; copy of output file showing the error;
&mdash; copy of pages/website being analysed;
&mdash; precise command used;
&mdash; configuration file(s) used, if any;
&mdash; any ndx file or other pre&ndash;existing file used during the run;
&mdash; any known workarounds or solutions;
&mdash; optionally, a dance interpretation of the &lsquo;feature&rsquo;;
and emailing everything to mail@ssc.lu (if the collected files are more
than small, please use a public fileserver and email the link). Do NOT
send anything confidential. Furthermore, unless you state otherwise,
we reserve the right to publish some or all of the information sent in
future versions of ssc, usually in the test suite. If you have a fix,
you are invited to submit a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/devongarde/ssc">github</a>. Thank you.



SSC can be run in a CGI environment. This is intended for use with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">OpenBSD&rsquo;s native httpd web server</a>.
You are reminded that SSC is &alpha; software. Do NOT expose it to untrusted data
sources, such as the open web, without taking serious precautions. SSC probably has
more bugs than the Creator&rsquo;s Ultimate All&ndash;Beetle Extravaganza (J.B.S.
Haldane, apocryphal : &ldquo;[the Creator has] an inordinate fondness for beetles.&rdquo;).



Notes on names:

&mdash; toast: toasts code; i liked burnt toast;

Background
I have a website, <a href="https://dylanharris.org/">arts &amp; ego, at https://dylanharris.org/</a>. It has
approaching 60G of original content. It contains hand coded HTMLs 2,
3, 4 &amp; 5. It is a complete mess. Despite a long search, I could not
find any tools to properly identify its flaws. Anything I did find
was at most cursory.

Then came the cow flu<sup>*</sup>.

<sup>*</sup>corvid means crow, thus covid means cow<sup>**</sup>.

<sup>**</sup>by the rules of sympathetic spelling.

NAME
ssc - analyse static web site source



SYNOPSIS
ssc [...] directory
ssc -f config
ssc



DESCRIPTION
ssc (the Static Site Checker) is an opinionated HTML nit-picker,
intended for people, such as its author, who hand code websites. It
doesn't just check static websites for broken links, dubious syntax,
and bad semantic data, it will actively complain about things that are
perfectly legal but rather untidy, like its author.

Except when serving CGI queries, it recursively scans the directory
looking for HTML source files to analyse. It produces a list of errors,
warnings, comments, and other hints of imperfection. Once complete, it
summarises internal site inconsistencies, and can produce some simple
statistics.

Scripts are ignored.



COMMAND LINE ONLY SWITCHES

These options are only available on the command line:

-f file                 Load configuration from file, which should be
                        in .INI file format. See CONFIGURATION FILE
                        FORMAT below. This should be an absolute path.

-F                      Load the configuration file .ssc/config in the
                        current directory.

-h                      Show a summary of switches, then exit.

-H snippet              Only nitpick this snippet of html

--ontology.list         List known schema versions, then exit.

-V                      Show version details, then exit.

--validation            Show attribute extensions, then exit. Attribute
                        extensions are additional values that can be
                        associated with attributes on some X/HTML
                        elements, and is intended for use with bespoke
                        extensions of HTML.



COMMAND LINE AND CONFIGURATION FILES SWITCHES

These options are available on the command line (with dashes) and in
configuration files (without dashes). The short form alternative
switches only work on the command line.

Most binary options, e.g. those without arguments below that turn on a
feature (which may be the default), have a corresponding "no-" switch
to turn it off. The "no-" is inserted after the dot, so, for example,
the contradiction to "--general.class" is "--general.no-class". When
both are specified, perhaps in a configuration file and on the command
line, the "no-" switch always applies.

--corpus.article        Prefer the content of &lt;ARTICLE&gt; when gathering
                        corpus text.

--corpus.body           Prefer the content of &lt;BODY&gt; when gathering
                        corpus text. This is the default.

--corpus.main           Prefer the content of &lt;MAIN&gt; when gathering
                        corpus text.

--corpus.output file    Dump XML corpus of site into file. This is
                        intended for use by a local search engine. If
                        none of --corpus.article, --corpus.body, or
                        --corpus.main are specified, the content of
                        &lt;BODY&gt; is used. If more than one are specified,
                        then the text collected depends on a page's
                        content. This is incompatible with
                        --shadow.update.

                        4.

                        where X is 0, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

                        The years are CSS snapshots, whether the year
                        itself for stable modules, with + for wobbly
                        modules, and ++ for wibbly-wobbly modules, as
                        per the corresponding W3 CSS snapshots (the
                        terminology in those snapshots is inconsistent,
                        hence our use of the scientific terms wobbly
                        and wibbly-wobbly).
                        For levels 3, 4, 5 and 6, note that extensions
                        that are part of neither CSS 1 nor CSS 2.x
                        specifications are numbered three and upwards
                        in ssc, for internal consistency. If you wish
                        to use an extension named ... level 1, that is
                        not part of CSS 1, specify 3. Similarly, for
                        those named level 2 that are not part of any
                        CSS 2 specification, etc..

--css.view  X           Use CSS View Transitions level X, where X is 0
                        or 3.

--css.wc X              Use CSS Will Change level X, where X is 0 or 3.

--css.writing X         Use CSS Writing Mode level X, where X is 0, 3
                        or 4.

--general.class         Nitpick class values

--general.classic       Report all classes used, not just those in
                        CSS files.

--general.cgi           Check environment variables for snippets of
-W                      HTML. SSC expects environment variables as
                        produced by OpenBSD's native httpd, produced
                        using &lt;FORM METHOD=GET &hellip;&gt;. Do NOT let ssc
                        anywhere near untrusted data. Ignores many
                        options such as shadowing.

--general.custom EL     Define a custom element &lt;EL&gt; for verifying the
                        IS attribute. May be repeated.

--general.datapath dir  Look for any configuration, caches, and other
-p dir                  useful files, in this directory.

--general.defthrd N     If --general.thread is not given, then set the
-N N                    number of threads to N.

--general.error x       If nits of the specified category or worse are
-E                      generated, then, on exit, return an error code.
                        Values are: 'catastrophe', 'error' (the
                        default), 'warning', 'info', or 'comment'.

--general.exclude xxx   Ignore all paths containing xxx. May be
                        repeated. Case independent under Windows only.
                        .DS_Store is always excluded in darwin (macos).

---general.file XXX      File for persistent data. Requires -N. See also
                        --general.datapath. Default extension: .ndx.

--general.ignore EL     ignore attributes and content of the element
                        &lt;EL&gt;. May  be repeated.

--general.info          Report launch context when starting.

--general.lang LA       If an X/HTML file does not have a language /
                        dialect specified (e.g. "en" for generic
                        English, "en-IE" for Irish English, "lb-LU"
                        for Luxembourgish, "ma" for Marain, etc.),
                        default to 'LA'. If not given, the default is
                        your system default, or, if none, then "en-US"
                        (the standard American dialect of English).

--general.maxfilesize n Do not process HTML source files that exceed n
                        bytes in size (default: 4M). Specify 0 for
                        unlimited, although be warned that ssc is
                        stunningly stupid in such circumstances and may
                        even attempt to load files bigger than
                        available memory.

--general.output        Output to the specified file. If this switch is
-o file                 not used, standard output is used.

--general.progress      Dump progress information to standard output.
-D                      This can interfere with formatted output.

--general.rdfa          Check RDFa attributes.

--general.rel           Only mention &lt;LINK&gt; REL values, found neither
                        in the living standard nor at microformats.org,
                        in debug output.

--general.rpt           Report CSS files that are opened.

--general.slob          Ignore perfectly legal yet inefficient, indeed
                        thoroughly slobby, HTML, such as being far too
                        lazy to get round to bothering to close
                        elements.

--general.spec          Reset the values of most switches to false.
-j

--general.ssi           Process Server Side Includes (SSIs). Note ssc
-I                      cannot process SSIs directives with formulae.
                        Processing SSIs may cause incorrect line
                        numbers to be mentioned when an issue is
                        reported.

--general.test          Output data in automated test format. Used by
-T                      ssc-test. Not generally useful. Documented so
                        you can avoid it!

--general.thread N      Use N threads when running. Defaults to a value
-n N                    appropriate for the hardware. Too high a value
                        can cause problems. See also --general.defthrd.

--general.vcs           Excludes, as per --general.exclude:
                            .bazaar
                            .bk
                            CVS
                            .cvsignore
                            _darcs
                            .fslckout
                            .git
                            .gitattributes
                            .gitignore
                            .gitmodules
                            .pijul
                            RCS
                            SCCS
                            .svn

--general.verbose x     Output nits to the specified verbosity:
-v                      'catastrophe', 'error', 'warning', 'info',
                        'comment' (the default), or '0' for silence.
                        Additional values are available when debugging.
                        Each level includes its preceding level, so,
                        for example, 'warning' will also output
                        'catastrophe' and 'error' nits.

--html.force            If &lt;!DOCTYPE. &hellip;&gt; is missing, force presumption
                        of --html.version value, not HTML 1/tags

--html.ie               Don't mention certain Internet Explorer features.

--html.rfc1867          Ignore the RFC 1867 (INPUT=FILE) extension when
                        processing HTML 2.0

--html.rfc1942          Ignore the RFC 1942 (tables) extension when
                        processing HTML 2.0.

--html.rfc1980          Ignore the RFC 1980 (client side image maps)
                        extension when processing HTML 2.0.

--html.rfc2070          Ignore the RFC 2070 (internationalisation)
                        extension when processing HTML 2.0.

--html.safari           Don't mention certain early Safari features.

--html.tags             When an HTML file is loaded that contains no
                        DOCTYPE, ssc normally presumes HTML 1. This
                        switch tells it to presume the file conforms
                        to an earlier HTML Tags specification (the one
                        at CERN). This is overridden by --html.version.

--html.title n          If &lt;TITLE&gt; text is longer than n characters,
-z n                    say so. This applies to text enclosed by a
                        &lt;TITLE&gt; element under &lt;HEAD&gt;, not the value of
                        TITLE attributes.

--html.version X        If no doctype (or xml header) is specified,
                        presume version X of HTML. X can be:

                        Although you can specify exact dates for
                        versions of the WhatWG HTML 5 living standard,
                        currently only broad versions published in
                        January and July are supported (quarterly
                        from 2021).

                        Certain versions of HTML offer variants, such
                        as loose and strict definitions. ssc picks
                        those up from the &lt;!DOCTYPE &hellip;&gt; in the HTML
                        file, if any, and then carefully ignores them.

                        Validation of XHTML is even less strict.

                        Just to remind you, there are no guarantees of
                        accuracy (or inaccuracy).

                        Copies of the appropriate standards can be
                        found online. A copy of the copies referenced
                        during ssc's development can be found at
                        https://ssc.lu/.

--link.301              Normally, when ssc checks external links
-3                      (--link.external), it does not report http
                        forwarding errors 301 and 308. Use this switch
                        to have it do so.

--link.check            Check internal links, e.g. those within the
-l                      website being analysed.

--link.example          Report links to faux domains, as defined by RFC
                        2606 (note ssc also reports links to
                        example.edu, example.gov & example.mil).

--link.external         Check external links, e.g. those not on the
-e                      site being checked. Note that ssc will NOT
                        check RFC 2606 links, such as example.com (see
                        --link.example).

--link.forward          Report HTTP forwarding errors encountered when
                        checking external links (e.g. 301 and 308)

--link.ignore DOMAIN    When checking external links, ignore this
                        domain. May be repeated.

--link.local            Report links to local domains, such as domains
                        ending in .lan, .home, .corp, and others.

--link.once             Only report each broken external link once. If,
-O                      for example, the site has a number of references
                        to a page that does not exist, ssc will only
                        report the first instance of the broken link.
                        Note that, even if it reports every occurrence
                        of the link, it will only check it the first
                        time it's encountered (requires
                        --link.external).

--link.pretend FILE     Pretend links containing xxx exist. May be
                        repeated.

--link.report DOMAIN    Report links to domain and its descendents. May
                        be repeated.

--link.revoke           Do not check whether links' https certificates
-r                      have been revoked (requires --link.external).

--link.xlink            Check crosslink IDs on the site being analysed.
-X                      For example, if a link goes to /index.html#id,
                        then, when this switch is set, ssc will verify
                        that the id exists and that it is not hidden.

--microdata.export      Export schema.org microdata encountered. This
                        data is exported in JSON format (not JSON-LD).

--microdata.root DIR    When exporting microdata with
                        --microdata.export, write files into the
                        directory DIR. ssc will create the directory
                        tree structure as appropriate.

--microdata.verify      Check microdata found in WhatWG microdata
-m                      attributes (itemprop, itemtype, etc.). Note
                        that ssc only knows about certain ontologies
                        (see --ontology.list)

--microdata.virtual v=d When exporting microdata using
                        --microdata.export, export the contents of
                        virtual directory 'v' to 'd'. 'v' must match a
                        directory identified with --site.virtual. For
                        example:
                            --microdata.virtual virtual=X:\virtual.

--microformat.export    Export microformat data encountered in JSON
                        format. This option will write files in the
                        same directory as the source, with the
                        extension .json.

--microformat.verify    Verify Microformats data in class and rel
-M                      attributes (see https://microformats.org/).

--microformat.version x Presume microformats version x. The following
                        values are currently accepted:
                                1   microformats version 1 only
                                2   microformats version 2 only
                                3   both microformats versions 1 and 2

--nits.catastrophe n    redefine nit n as a catastrophe; may be
                        repeated (the value of n can be determined
                        using --nits.nids below).

--nits.comment n        Redefine nit n as a comment; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using
                        --nits.nids).

--nits.debug n          Redefine nit n as a debug message; may be
                        repeated (the value of n can be determined
                        using --nits.nids).

--nits.error n          Redefine nit n as an error; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using
                        --nits.nids).

--nits.extra            Report additional nits.

--nits.format F         Specify the output format; F is a template
                        file (see OUTPUT TEMPLATE below).

--nits.info n           Redefine nit n as information; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using
                        --nits.nids).

--nits.nids             Output nit ids, which can be used to redefine
                        nits.

--nits.override F       Use this output format, not the one specified
                        by --nits.format. F is a template file (see
                        OUTPUT TEMPLATE below). This switch is intended
                        to aid automation.

--nits.quote X          Specify quote style when using nit.format. X
                        can be 'text' or 'html'.

                        the website root.

--nits.silence n        Silence nit n; may be repeated (the value of n
                        can be determined using --nits.nids).

--nits.unique           Do not output repeated nits, even if they may
                        contain additional information.

--nits.warning n        Redefine nit n as a warning; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using
                        --nits.nids).

--nits.watch            Output debug nits (intended for automation).

--rdfa.version          When checking RDFa files, presume this version
                        (default: 1.1.3). Note, RDFa analyis is
                        incomplete, and only intended for supporting
                        HTML analysis.

--ontology.ONT X.Y      Presume version X.Y of ontology ONT. For
                        example:
                            --ontology.xsd 1.1
                        defaults usage of XSD to version 1.1. The
                        versions apply to RDFa, microdata, and
                        microformats (using class) analysis. If .Y is
                        omitted, .0 is presumed. X must be present.
                        Unspecified defaults are derived from the HTML
                        version. For a list of possible values, use
                        --ontology.list.

                        At the time of writing, the following ontology
                        versions can be verified. Note that single
                        version ontologies cannot have their version
                        changed:

                        The various Adobe ontologies (crs, pdf,
                        photoshop, stdim, stevt, stfnt, stjob, stref,
                        stver, smp, xmpdm, xmpg, xmpgimg, xmpidq,
                        xmpmm, xmprights, xmptpg) have only been
                        partially applied. They do not seem to have
                        been designed for microdata, hence the partial
                        implementation: the goal is to enable hoovering
                        to JSON.

                        BFO (Basic Format Ontology) versions should be
                        specified as follows:
                                Use         For
                                2.0         2.0
                                2.2         2020

                        BFO 2020 uses OBO's machine code style
                        identifiers. Given the history of computing
                        science, as a convenience for users, and with
                        my experience of both devops and maintaining
                        code, identifiers following the standard
                        ontology naming convention are also accepted.
                        Since this is unofficial, both standard English
                        and American dialects' spellings are processed.

                        The Exif & ExifEx ontologies have the following
                        versions:
                            Use     For
                            1.0     1.0 (exif only)

                        Manufacturers' extensions to EXIF are omitted,
                        with exceptions.

                        Open Graph versions correspond to snapshots of
                        the specs from 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018 & 2022.

                        The various Prism ontologies (pam, pamp, pcm,
                        pcmm, pcv, pim, pmi, prism, prism_ad, prl, prm,
                        prs, psv, pur) have only been partially
                        applied: some specifications are unavailable,
                        some specifications break HTML5 syntax. Prism
                        was not designed for microdata, hence the
                        partial implementation: the goal is to enable
                        hoovering to JSON.

                        Most versions of schema (schema.org) should be
                        specified by their version number, but this
                        doesn't work with early versions, which should
                        be specified a follows:

                        vCard versions correspond to RDFa specs,
                        published in 2001, 2006, 2010 & 2014. They do
                        NOT correspond to vCard data format
                        specifications.

--shadow.changed        When shadowing a site that has been previously
                        shadowed, only copy/link files that have
                        changed.

--shadow.comment        Do not delete comments when writing shadow
                        pages.

--shadow.copy X         Create a shadow directory structure from source
                        HTML files, with errors removed and some things
                        tidied up. X can be:
                                no     copy nothing (default)
                                pages  write 'fixed' source files,
                                       ignore non source files
                                hard   set up hard links to non-source
                                       files (requires source and
                                       shadow directories to be on the
                                       same disk) (see below)
                                soft   set up soft links to non-source
                                       files (see below)
                                all    copy non HTML files too
                                dedu   copy non HTML files too, but
                                       deduplicate them, changing links
                                       in HTML source if necessary (see
                                       below)
                                report report duplicates (no
                                       shadowing)
                        ssc cannot convert between versions of HTML,
                        nor between HTML and XHTML.
                        Link options are only available on systems that
                        support links.

--shadow.enable         Enable shadowing (set by other shadow options).
                        If shadowing is enabled, but shadow.root is not
                        set, SSC will litter the site source
                        directories with .ndx files.

--shadow.file f         Write ssc's shadow cache to file f, to
                        accelerate future shadowing of the same
                        content updated.

--shadow.ignore ext     When shadowing, ignore files with this
                        extension (may be repeated).

--shadow.info           Add a comment at or near the top of each
                        shadowed HTML file noting its generation time.

--shadow.msg text       Insert a comment containing text at the top of
                        each generated page. Note that, if any SSI
                        include file is updated, the comment will
                        appear whether or not the original page has
                        changed.

--shadow.root dir       Where to write the shadowed site.

--shadow.space          Leave excess/repeated spaces and blank lines in
                        the shadowed files untidily untouched.

--shadow.ssi            Do NOT resolve Server Side Includes when
                        shadowing, even if --general.ssi is set.

--shadow.update         Only examine files that have changed since the
-u                      last time ssc ran. This is incompatible with
                        --corpus.file. This requires --shadow.file.
                        Nits of files that have not changed will not be
                        reported.

--shadow.virtual v=d    When shadowing virtual directories, output the
                        shadow of virtual directory 'v' to directory
                        'd'. 'v' must match a directory set up using
                        --site.virtual.

--site.domain domain    The domain name of the site is 'domain'. This
-S domain               can be repeated. This is used to identify any
                        URL that is apparently external but is actually
                        internal to the site.

--site.extension ext    Treat files with this extension as X/HTML
-x ext                  source files. This may be repeated. Files with
                        extension .html are always checked.

--site.index file       This is the name of the default file in a
-i file                 directory. This can be repeated. This is used
                        for checking internal links.

--site.root dir         This is the root of the website to analyse. ssc
-g dir                  will recursively scan the directory analysing
                        any HTML files it finds. The default is the
                        current directory.

--site.virtual v=d      The virtual directory 'v' is located in actual
-L v=d                  directory 'd' on the local filesystem. For
                        example:
                            --site.virtual virtual=D:\actual

--spell.accept XXX      XXX is a correct spelling of a word (or a list
                        of words) in all languages.

--spell.cased           Nitpick correctly spelt but wrongly cased
                        words.

--spell.check           Check text spelling. Uses external spelling
                        checkers, so results will be inconsistent
                        between systems.

--spell.dict LANG,DICT  Unix only. Associate dictionary DICT with LANG.
                        For example, if the standard English dictionary
                        is en_GB-large:
                            --spell.dict en-GB,en_GB-large
                        (Under Windows, ssc uses the OS dictionaries.)

--spell.icu             If "no", do not use the ICU libraries at all
                        (they are rather slow). This will increase the
                        inaccuracy and incorrectness of the spell checks.

--spell.list FN,LANG    The file FN contains a list of valid spellings
                        for language LANG (which may include country
                        info). If LANG is omitted, the valid spellings
                        apply to all languages. For example:
                            --spell.list villages.txt,en-IE
                            --spell.list dorfer.txt,de
                            --spell.list letzstied.txt

--spell.path PATH       Unix only. Path to spelling executable.
                        Hunspell or a compatible program is expected.
                        If none is specified, ssc will seek hunspell.
                        (Under Windows, ssc uses the OS spellchecker.)

--stats.abbr            Output abbreviation report, so you can verify
                        the same abbreviations have the same expansions
                        across the site.

--stats.all             Output all statistics reports.

--stats.annotation      Output annotation report.

--stats.attribute       Output element attribute report, which expands
                        the element report to output information about
                        attributes used.

--stats.category        Output category report, which output the total
                        quantity of nits reported by nit category.

--stats.character-variant Output character variant report.

--stats.class           Output class report, which allows to you see
                        which classes are defined in CSS but not used,
                        which classes are used but not defined, as well
                        as a count of both for all classes encountered.

--stats.content-name    Output content name report.

--stats.counter-style   Output counter style report.

--stats.css-property    Output css property report, which gives you an
                        idea of the sophistication of the CSS used on
                        the site.

--stats.custom-media    Output custom media report, which lists all
                        named custom media definitions encountered.

--stats.custom-property Output custom property report, which lists all
                        named custom property definitions encountered.

--stats.definition      Output definitions report, so you can verify
                        the same terms have the same definitions across
                        the site.

                        which ids are styled but not mentioned.

--stats.itemid          Output itemid report, which gives you an idea
                        of the ontological significance and depth of
                        the site.

--stats.keyframe        Output keyframe report, which lists all named
                        keyframes.

                        those found in the HTML source, not those
                        returned by the HTTP protocol. Remember that
                        many web servers (not all) will remove some
                        pragmas when serving pages.

--stats.name-value      Output name/value pairs report, which helps
                        you identify inconsistencies between

                        band themselves.

--stats.summary         Produce a summary of overall statistics for the
                        website, including grand totals.

--stats.version         Output version report, which summarises
                        versions of HTML, SVG, MathML, etc.,
                        encountered.

--stats.view            Output view report, which reports all CSS named
                        views encountered.

--svg.version x         Presume any SVG code encountered is this
                        version, unless the SVG code itself specifies a
                        version. Versions recognised:
                            1.0
                            1.1
                            1.2      (really 1.2/tiny)
                            1.2/tiny
                            1.2/full (May 2004 draft, incomplete, any
                                      conflict with 1.2/tiny always

                            2.1 (April 2021 draft)
                        If this switch is not used, and some SVG code
                        does not identify its version, the version is
                        derived from the version of the host X/HTML
                        code.

--validation.attribute ATT
                        Add the custom attribute ATT. This attribute
                        will be ignored, not validated.

                        repeated.

--validation.element EL Accept &lt;EL&gt; as a valid element. This element
                        will be ignored, not validated. May be
                        repeated.

--validation.element-attribute EL,ATT
                        Accept the known attribute ATT on the element
                        &lt;EL&gt;. Doesn't work with namespaces (names
                        containing ':'). May be repeated.

--validation.extension EXT
                        Accept the extension EXT as a mimetype file
                        extension. May be repeated.

--validation.ff FEATURE Accept FEATURE as a CSS font feature. These
                        should normally be four characters long. May be
                        repeated.

--validation.ff VARIATION
                        Accept VARIATION as a CSS font variation. These

--validation.httpequiv HEQ
                        Accept HEQ as a valid macro for httpequiv on
                        &lt;META&gt; elements. May be repeated.

--validation.lang LANG  Accept LANG as a valid language code. May be
                        repeated.

--validation.minor x    When validating W3 HTML 5 source code, using
-m x                    this minor version of W3 HTML 5. Valid values
                        are 0, 1, 2, and 3 (draft). WhatWG versions are
                        determined by date, corresponding roughly to
                        the date of the (online) publication of the
                        specific version. See the --html.version
                        switch.

--validation.metaname M
                        Accept M as valid for the NAME attribute of the

                        be repeated.

--validation.XXX YYY    Accept YYY as a valid value for attribute type
                        XXX. For a list of possible values of XXX, use
                        the command line switch --validation.



CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

If a configuration file is used, it should be in INI file format. All
content is optional.

Section and option names are derived from the long form switch name,
which consists of --SECTION.OPTION, laid out in the format:

[SECTION]
OPTION=yes
OPTION=123456

Switches that do not have a long form version cannot be used in a
configuration file.

Each ssc test (in the recipe/toast folder) has a configuration file;
browse them for examples.



ENVIRONMENT

If you set --general.cgi, ssc will check these environment variables:

QUERY_STRING            Run under OpenBSD's httpd server. See notes
                        below.
SSC_CONFIG              If no configuration file is given on the
                        command line, use this one
SSC_ARGS                Preliminary command line parameters

If, when SSC is run, the environment variable QUERY_STRING is set to an
OpenBSD httpd server CGI value that includes the parameter
html.snippet, then SSC will nitpick that snippet only. Some other
parameters are processed, including general.verbose and html.version.



EXIT STATUS

If no significant nits are found, ssc exits with 0, otherwise it exits
with a value &gt; 0. See the --general.error switch.



OUTPUT TEMPLATE

The --nit.format switch allows control of output format. It takes a
file name. The format of that text file is a sequence of fixed section
names, enclosed in square brackets on their own lines, each optionally
followed by text. In that text, certain specific identifiers, enclosed
in brace pairs, are substituted. For example:

[dog-section]
My pet dog {{dog-name}} is a {{bad-dog}}.

For examples, browse recipe/toast/output/*.nit

If no file is specified, or if the file cannot be loaded, a default
template is used.

Note also the --nit.quote switch.



EXAMPLES

To verify the version of ssc:
ssc -V

To check the static web side source directory /home/site/wwwroot:
ssc /home/site/wwwroot

To check a static HTML/XHTML website for example.com, that uses server
side includes, in the current directory, with verification of external
links, with rather verbose output:
ssc -e -I -x html -x shtml -s example.com -v 5 -i index.shtml

To check a static web side in the current directory, with a virtual
directory, verifying microformats:
ssc -L vitual=/home/site/virtual -M

To check a static web site using a configuration file:
ssc -f config.file


A simple configuration file

[general]
verbose=5
output=ssc.out
class=

[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=~/www/htdocs

The website for example.edu can be found in ~/www.htdocs. Standard
index files are called index.html, and html files always have the html
extension.

The configuration outputs errors, warnings and info messages to
ssc.out. It analyses class identifiers, so will scan CSS files for
class names.


Links and virtual directories

[general]
verbose=5
output=ssc.out

[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=~/www/htdocs
virtual=/net=tests/virtual

[link]
check=
external=
xlink=

Beyond the previous example, SSC will also check links, including
external links and crosslinked ids.

The configuration file specifies a virtual directory. When a link
refers to the local directory /net, SSC will seek the corresponding
file(s) in tests/virtual (relative to the current directory, not the
root).


Microformats

[general]
verbose=5
output=ssc.out
class=

[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=~/www/htdocs

[microformat]
verify=

The only new thing here is to turn on microformats analysis (class
analysis is required).


Microdata

[general]
verbose=5
output=ssc.out
class=

[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=~/www/htdocs

Actually, SSC will report on any microdata it finds, no matter what.
Note that, if you use itemref in your pages, ssc may give false
warnings in the section referenced by the itemref. This is because ssc
does not always know that the referenced data is not intended to be
used in its own right, unless you put it under a TEMPLATE element.

You can export the microdata encountered in JSON file format by using
the export setting (not shown).


Statistics

[general]
ssi=
verbose=5
output=ssc.out
class=

[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
extension=shtml
index=index.html
root=~/www/htdocs

[stats]
summary=

Turn on summary statistics, which produces a grand total at the end of
a complete run (add ""page=" below summary for individual page stats).

Note that server side includes have been turned on using general.ssi,
and files with the SHTML extension will be treated as web pages.


MathML 2

This configuration file could be used to test MathML 2.

[general]
verbose=5
output=m2.out
class=

[link]
check=

[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=~/www/htdocs

[math]
version=2

[validation]
citype=function
citype=list
citype=logical
citype=matrix
citype=set
citype=var-x
citype=vector

What's interesting here is the validation section. The MathML
documentation lists a specific set of values that can be used with the
TYPE attribute on the CI element. The examples in the specification
give this attribute many additional, and apparently illegal, values.
(This apparent inconsistency is not uncommon amongst web
specifications.) The way to avoid SSC complaining about these extra
values is to give CI TYPE additional values in the configuration file,
as noted.

Indeed, many enumerated attribute values can be extended in this way.
Use the --validation switch to get a complete list.


arts & ego

This is the configuration file I used to analyse my site.

[general]

fontname=TrebuchetMS-Italic

My site has been built by hand over the decades, and is full of errors.
I wrote ssc because I was frustrated that I could find no tool to
properly check it. Unfortunately, SSC is too successful: it finds
a gadzillion errors in arts & ego. I am slowly making the repairs.


OpenBSD website

Perhaps you've grabbed a copy of the OpenBSD website from github
(https://github.com/openbsd/www.git):

POTENTIAL GOTCHAS

For HTML, ssc defaults to a version of the living standard that's
contemporary to the version of ssc. The same applies to other document
types. In all cases, though, if the document itself specifies a
particular version (such as HTML 3.2), then that applies.

The version indicated by the DOCTYPE can be very broad. For example,
the HTML 5 doctype specifies HTML 5 alone, but not which flavour (W3 or
living standard), nor which revision.

If you are verifying HTML, and it contains some CSS, MathML, SVG, or
other content, then ssc will attempt to guess the version of the latter
from the former (unless you tell it which to use).

All this is why that, if you want to be precise about document
verification, specify versions, either with a switch or an entry in a
configuration file. If your HTML contains MathML/SVG/etc. snippets,
then specify those versions too.

BUILD NOTES
static site checker
https://ssc.lu/
(c) 2020-2024 Dylan Harris


Introduction
============
SSC can be built on various unii with CMake and gcc or clang,
supporting C++ 17 or better, or with Visual Studios 2017 / 2019 / 2022
under Windows. I have built & tested a 64-bit version in selected OSs
on intel/amd & arm64 (m2) architecture. 

Although ssc builds and runs with older compilers on older systems, not
all features are available on them.


Libraries
=========

Common dependencies
-------------------
You need boost version 1.75 or better (https://boost.org), a recent
version of the ICU libraries (https://icu-project.org/), Microsoft's
GSL library (https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL) (or define NO_GSL), and
a recent version of libcurl (https://curl.se/)*. Usually, an Operating
System's package system has an appropriate version ready to install.

*libcurl requires a thread-safe underlying SSL library: see
https://curl.se/libcurl/c/threadsafe.html

You may need to set these environment variables:
- BOOST: if you're not using your operating system's packaged flavour
  of boost, then set BOOST to your boost source root directory;
- ICU_ROOT: if you're not using your operating system's packaged ICU,
  set ICU_ROOT to your ICU source root directory;
- GSL: set it to your GSL root directory.

hunspell
--------
Building SSC under unii, including macos, requires a development
installation of hunspell (https://hunspell.github.io/).

Once you've got them, you can run cmake from the project root
directory.

winspell
--------
The Windows build, by default, uses the native Windows spellchecker,
although, except for Windows 11, that doesn't seem to work so well in
multilingual contexts.


Building
========

Windows
-------
To build from Visual Studio, navigate to recipe/tea, open the
appropriate .sln file, then build. Only Visual Studios 2017, 2019 and
2022, have been built & tested, for amd64 (x64) and arm64 (M2), under
Windows 10 & 11.

Note the included solutions presume Microsoft's VCPKG manager. There
are alternatives.

On low memory machines, disable the /MP switch.



Unii & mock Unii
----------------
You will need CMake 3.19 or better. On Linux, you will also need
lsb-release. These can be found in most distributions' standard
packages. (For macos, I used macports, but brew is good too.)
From the home ssc directory, compile a normal build thus:
cmake .
make
ctest
make install

For a debug build:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
make
ctest
make install

If everything works correctly, then everything will be built, a series
of tests run, with a final result at the very end saying no failures.
Having said that, given SSC is alpha, don't be too surprised to see
some warnings or some final test errors. Note in particular that
complaints about being unable to find or copy files during testing are
not of concern, these come from scripts that set up or tear down
individual tests, and the standard commands used sometimes complain if
they can't find files they're supposed to delete, which is a bit silly
given that means things are already in the desired state.

The following have, at some point, been successfully built as x64 amd:
FreeBSD:  13.2 / 13.1 / 12.4 / 12.3
Linux:    Alma Linux 9, AOSC, Centos 8 / 9, SUSE Tumbleweed,
          Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04
MacOS:    Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, High
          Sierra, Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite
OpenBSD:  7.4 / 7.3 / 7.2 / 7.1 / 7.0 / 6.9 / 6.8

The following have been successfully built as arm64:
Linux:    Centos 9
MacOS:    Sonoma, Ventura

The current version of ssc requires the current version of an operating
system. Older operating systems require older versions of ssc. Not all
features work on all systems.

Centos 9
--------
The appropriate CMake command is:
  cmake . -DFLAVOUR=CentosOSStream -DFLAVOUR_VER=9
(beware the standard English spelling of flavour.)

OpenBSD
-------
You may need to increase significantly the available memory setting
for your build account in login.conf.


Testing
=======

Windows
-------
Under Visual Studio, run ssc??-test using these arguments:

  -v -x $(ProjectDir)..\..\ssc.exe
    -f $(ProjectDir)..\toast\ssc-test\win.lst
(all one line)

Add '-d' if you want the test utility to retain intemediate files.

CMake
-----
Under CMake, run ctest:
  ctest -V
(which runs ssc-test for you, using nix.lst).

Dimitude
--------
The testing utility is rather dim; it will test features that are not
built, causing failures.

Spelling test results depend on the dictionaries installed.


Supporting libraries
====================

GSL
---
If you can't find a copy of Microsoft's GSL in your system's standard
package suite, then grab a current copy from its github repository
(https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL), then unpack, build and install it.
In Windows, remember to add its root directory to your local path.

Curl
----
This is in every standard unix flavour repository that I've met, but
not so easy for Windows. I suggest the following:

1  Install the Microsoft repository vcpkg (https://vcpkg.io)
2  Run up the visual studio 64bit native command prompt
3  Run the vcpkg bootstrap batch file, noting the comments
4  Enter "vcpkg install curl:x64-windows"
5  Add an environment variable to your account for CURL, perhaps:
    CURL=****\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows
6  Add the installation bin directory to your local path, perhaps:
    ****\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin
7  If you plan to debug, also add debug\bin, perhaps:
    ****\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\debug\bin

Adapt the architecture as necessary. If you omit it, vcpkg might
carefully ignore your hardware and install x86.

Boost
-----
Boost is to C++ as breakfast is to the working day.

Most package managers support it, including vcpkg. Many people build
their own versions using the sources found at boost.org.

<h3>notes</h3>

<p>
If everything works correctly, then everything will be built, a series of tests run, with a final result at the very end saying no failures.
Having said that, given SSC is &alpha;, don&rsquo;t be too surprised to see some warnings or some final test errors. Worse, some tests have
dependencies that vary across systems, which can cause spurious test failures.
