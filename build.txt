Introduction
------------
SSC can be built from various unii command lines using CMake, or with Visual Studios 2017 / 2019 under Windows.


Libraries
---------
Before you can build SSC, you may find you need to install and build boost version 1.75 or better, and a recent version
of the ICU libraries. Most unii have both available as packages.

You may need to set these environment variables:
BOOST_ROOT to point to the boost source root directory (https://boost.org);
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR to point to the boost include directory;
BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to point to the boost lib directory;
ICU_ROOT to point to the ICU library source root directory (https://icu-project.org/);
SSCPATH to point to the ssc source directory (https://ssc.lu/).


Windows
-------
To build from Visual Studio, navigate to recipe\tea, open the appropriate .sln file, then build. Both x86 and x64 builds
work, although the x86 executable cannot analyse larger websites. Visual Studios 2017 & 2019 have been built & tested,
for Windows 8.1 & 10.


Unii & mock Unii
----------------
You will need CMake 3.12 or better on your system.

From the home ssc directory, compile thus:

cd recipe/tea
cmake .
make
ctest
make install

If everything works correctly, then everything will be built, a series of tests run, with a final result at the very end
saying no failures. Having said that, given SSC is pre-alpha, don't be too surprised to see some warnings or some final test
errors. Note in particular that complaints about being unable to find or copy files during testing are not of concern, these
come from scripts that set up or tear down individual tests, and the standard commands used sometimes complain if they can't
find files they're supposed to delete, rather than saying thank you for the reduced work.

The following have successfully built, although not always under all versions of ssc:
Linux: Centos 8 amd64, Ubuntu Server 20.04/20.10 amd64
OpenBSD 6.8: amd64
MacOS: Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave & High Sierra x64


OpenBSD 6.8 amd64
-----------------
The versions of boost and cmake in packages are sufficient. You will need to increase significantly the available
memory setting in login.conf for the build account, if you have not done so already.
