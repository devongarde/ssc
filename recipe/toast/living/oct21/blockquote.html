<p>The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with.
It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held
prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to
be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true. We have a
method, and that method helps us to reach not absolute truth, only
asymptotic approaches to the truth — never there, just closer
and closer, always finding vast new oceans of undiscovered
possibilities. Cleverly designed experiments are the key.</p>
