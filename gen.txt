NAME
ssc - analyse static web site source



SYNOPSIS
ssc [...] directory
ssc -f config
ssc



DESCRIPTION
ssc (the Static Site Checker) is an opinionated HTML nit-picker,
intended for people, such as its author, who hand code websites. It
doesn't just check static websites for broken links, dubious syntax,
and bad semantic data, it will actively complain about things that are
perfectly legal but rather untidy, like its author.

Except when serving CGI queries, it recursively scans the directory
looking for HTML source files to analyse. It produces a list of errors,
warnings, comments, and other hints of imperfection. Once complete, it
summarises internal site inconsistencies, and can produce some simple
statistics.

Scripts are ignored.



COMMAND LINE ONLY SWITCHES

These options are only available on the command line:

-f file                 Load configuration from file, which should be
                        in .INI file format. See CONFIGURATION FILE
                        FORMAT below. This should be an absolute path.

-F                      Load the configuration file .ssc/config in the
                        current directory.

-h                      Show a summary of switches, then exit.

-H snippet              Only nitpick this snippet of html

--ontology.list         List known schema versions, then exit.

-V                      Show version details, then exit.

--validation            Show attribute extensions, then exit. Attribute
                        extensions are additional values that can be
                        associated with attributes on some X/HTML
                        elements, and is intended for use with bespoke
                        extensions of HTML.



COMMAND LINE AND CONFIGURATION FILES SWITCHES

These options are available on the command line (with dashes) and in
configuration files (without dashes). The short form alternative
switches only work on the command line.

Most binary options, e.g. those without arguments below that turn on a
feature (which may be the default), have a corresponding "no-" switch
to turn it off. The "no-" is inserted after the dot, so, for example,
the contradiction to "--general.class" is "--general.no-class". When
both are specified, perhaps in a configuration file and on the command
line, the "no-" switch always applies.

--corpus.article        Prefer the content of <ARTICLE> when gathering
                        corpus text.

--corpus.body           Prefer the content of <BODY> when gathering
                        corpus text. This is the default.

--corpus.main           Prefer the content of <MAIN> when gathering
                        corpus text.

--corpus.output file    Dump XML corpus of site into file. This is
                        intended for use by a local search engine. If
                        none of --corpus.article, --corpus.body, or
                        --corpus.main are specified, the content of
                        <BODY> is used. If more than one are specified,
                        then the text collected depends on a page's
                        content. This is incompatible with
                        --shadow.update.

--css.writing X         Use CSS Writing Mode level X, where X is 0, 3

--general.class         Nitpick class values

--general.classic       Report all classes used, not just those in
                        CSS files.

--general.cgi           Check environment variables for snippets of
-W                      HTML. SSC expects environment variables as
                        produced by OpenBSD's native httpd, produced
                        using <FORM METHOD=GET ...>. Do NOT let ssc
                        anywhere near untrusted data. Ignores many
                        options such as shadowing.

--general.custom EL     Define a custom element <EL> for verifying the
                        IS attribute. May be repeated.

--general.datapath dir  Look for any configuration, caches, and other
-p dir                  useful files, in this directory.

--general.defthrd N     If --general.thread is not given, then set the
-N N                    number of threads to N.

--general.error x       If nits of the specified category or worse are
-E                      generated, then, on exit, return an error code.
                        Values are: 'catastrophe', 'error' (the
                        default), 'warning', 'info', or 'comment'.

--general.exclude REG   Ignore all files that match the posix regular
                        expression REG. May be repeated.

--general.file XXX      File for persistent data. Requires -N. See also
                        --general.datapath. Default extension: .ndx.

--general.git           Ignore git's internal files.

--general.ignore EL     ignore attributes and content of the element
                        <EL>. May  be repeated.

--general.info          Report launch context when starting.

--general.lang LA       If an X/HTML file does not have a language /
                        dialect specified (e.g. "en" for generic
                        English, "en-IE" for Irish English, "lb-LU"
                        for Luxembourgish, "ma" for Marain, etc.),
                        default to 'LA'. If not given, the default is
                        your system default, or, if none, then "en-US".

--general.maxfilesize n Do not process HTML source files that exceed n
                        bytes in size (default: 4M). Specify 0 for
                        unlimited, although be warned that ssc is
                        stunningly stupid in such circumstances and may
                        even attempt to load files bigger than
                        available memory.

--general.output        Output to the specified file. If this switch is
-o file                 not used, standard output is used.

--general.progress      Dump progress information to standard output.
-D                      This can interfere with formatted output.

--general.rdfa          Check RDFa attributes.

--general.rel           Only mention <LINK> REL values, found neither
                        in the living standard nor at microformats.org,
                        in debug output.

--general.rpt           Report CSS files that are opened.

--general.slob          Ignore perfectly legal yet inefficient, indeed
                        thoroughly slobby, HTML, such as being far too
                        lazy to get round to bothering to close
                        elements.

--general.spec          Reset the values of most switches to false.
-j

--general.ssi           Process Server Side Includes (SSIs). Note ssc
-I                      cannot process SSIs directives with formulae.
                        Processing SSIs may cause incorrect line
                        numbers to be mentioned when an issue is
                        reported.

--general.test          Output data in automated test format. Used by
-T                      ssc-test. Not generally useful. Documented so
                        you can avoid it!

--general.thread N      Use N threads when running. Defaults to a value
-n N                    appropriate for the hardware. Too high a value
                        can cause problems. See also --general.defthrd.

--general.verbose x     Output nits to the specified verbosity:
-v                      'catastrophe', 'error', 'warning', 'info',
                        'comment' (the default), or '0' for silence.
                        Additional values are available when debugging.
                        Each level includes its preceding level, so,
                        for example, 'warning' will also output
                        'catastrophe' and 'error' nits.

--html.force            If <!DOCTYPE...> is missing, force presumption
                        of --html.version value, not HTML 1/tags

--html.ie               Don't mention certain Internet Explorer features.

--html.rfc1867          Ignore the RFC 1867 (INPUT=FILE) extension when
                        processing HTML 2.0

--html.rfc1942          Ignore the RFC 1942 (tables) extension when
                        processing HTML 2.0.

--html.rfc1980          Ignore the RFC 1980 (client side image maps)
                        extension when processing HTML 2.0.

--html.rfc2070          Ignore the RFC 2070 (internationalisation)
                        extension when processing HTML 2.0.

--html.safari           Don't mention certain early Safari features.

--html.tags             When an HTML file is loaded that contains no
                        DOCTYPE, ssc normally presumes HTML 1. This
                        switch tells it to presume the file conforms
                        to an earlier HTML Tags specification (the one
                        at CERN). This is overridden by --html.version.

--html.title n          If <TITLE> text is longer than n characters,
-z n                    say so. This applies to text enclosed by a
                        <TITLE> element under <HEAD>, not the value of
                        TITLE attributes.

--html.version X        If no doctype (or xml header) is specified,
                        presume version X of HTML. X can be:

                        Although you can specify exact dates for
                        versions of the WhatWG HTML 5 living standard,
                        currently only broad versions published in
                        January and July are supported (quarterly
                        from 2021).

                        Certain versions of HTML offer variants, such
                        as loose and strict definitions. ssc picks
                        those up from the <!DOCTYPE ...> in the HTML
                        file, if any, and then carefully ignores them.

                        Validation of XHTML is even less strict.

                        Just to remind you, there are no guarantees of
                        accuracy (or inaccuracy).

                        Copies of the appropriate standards can be
                        found online. A copy of the copies referenced
                        during ssc's development can be found at

-3                      (--link.external), it does not report http
                        forwarding errors 301 and 308. Use this switch
                        to have it do so.

--link.check            Check internal links, e.g. those within the
-l                      website being analysed.

--link.example          Report links to faux domains, as defined by RFC
                        2606 (note ssc also reports links to
                        example.edu, example.gov & example.mil).

--link.external         Check external links, e.g. those not on the
-e                      site being checked. Note that ssc will NOT
                        check RFC 2606 links, such as example.com (see
                        --link.example).

--link.forward          Report HTTP forwarding errors encountered when
                        checking external links (e.g. 301 and 308)

--link.ignore DOMAIN    When checking external links, ignore this
                        domain. May be repeated.

--link.local            Report links to local domains, such as domains
                        ending in .lan, .home, .corp, and others.

--link.once             Only report each broken external link once. If,
-O                      for example, the site has a number of references
                        to a page that does not exist, ssc will only
                        report the first instance of the broken link.
                        Note that, even if it reports every occurrence
                        of the link, it will only check it the first
                        time it's encountered (requires
                        --link.external).

--link.pretend FILE     When checking local files, pretend this file
                        exists.

--link.report DOMAIN    Report links to domain and its descendents. May
                        be repeated.

--link.revoke           Do not check whether links' https certificates
-r                      have been revoked (requires --link.external).

--link.xlink            Check crosslink IDs on the site being analysed.
-X                      For example, if a link goes to /index.html#id,
                        then, when this switch is set, ssc will verify
                        that the id exists and that it is not hidden.

--microdata.export      Export schema.org microdata encountered. This
                        data is exported in JSON format (not JSON-LD).

--microdata.root DIR    When exporting microdata with
                        --microdata.export, write files into the
                        directory DIR. ssc will create the directory
                        tree structure as appropriate.

--microdata.verify      Check microdata found in WhatWG microdata
-m                      attributes (itemprop, itemtype, etc.). Note
                        that ssc only knows about certain ontologies
                        (see --ontology.list)

--microdata.virtual v=d When exporting microdata using
                        --microdata.export, export the contents of
                        virtual directory 'v' to 'd'. 'v' must match a
                        directory identified with --site.virtual. For
                        example:
                            --microdata.virtual virtual=X:\virtual.

--microformat.export    Export microformat data encountered in JSON
                        format. This option will write files in the
                        same directory as the source, with the
                        extension .json.

--microformat.verify    Verify Microformats data in class and rel
-M                      attributes (see https://microformats.org/).

--microformat.version x Presume microformats version x. The following
                        values are currently accepted:

                                2   microformats version 2 only
                                3   both microformats versions 1 and 2

--nits.catastrophe n    redefine nit n as a catastrophe; may be
                        repeated (the value of n can be determined
                        using --nits.nids below).

--nits.comment n        Redefine nit n as a comment; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using
                        --nits.nids).

--nits.debug n          Redefine nit n as a debug message; may be
                        repeated (the value of n can be determined
                        using --nits.nids).

--nits.error n          Redefine nit n as an error; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using
                        --nits.nids).

--nits.extra            Report additional nits.

--nits.format F         Specify the output format; F is a template
                        file (see OUTPUT TEMPLATE below).

--nits.info n           Redefine nit n as information; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using
                        --nits.nids).

--nits.nids             Output nit ids, which can be used to redefine
                        nits.

--nits.override F       Use this output format, not the one specified
                        by --nits.format. F is a template file (see
                        OUTPUT TEMPLATE below). This switch is intended
                        to aid automation.

--nits.quote X          Specify quote style when using nit.format. X
                        can be 'text' or 'html'.

--nits.root             By default, seek nit output template files in
                        the website root.

--nits.silence n        Silence nit n; may be repeated (the value of n
                        can be determined using --nits.nids).

--nits.unique           Do not output repeated nits, even if they may
                        contain additional information.

--nits.warning n        Redefine nit n as a warning; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using
                        --nits.nids).

--nits.watch            Output debug nits (intended for automation).

--rdfa.version          When checking RDFa files, presume this version
                        (default: 1.1.3). Note, RDFa analyis is
                        incomplete, and only intended for supporting
                        HTML analysis.

--ontology.ONT X.Y      Presume version X.Y of ontology ONT. For
                        example:
                            --ontology.xsd 1.1
                        defaults usage of XSD to version 1.1. The
                        versions apply to RDFa, microdata, and
                        microformats (using class) analysis. If .Y is
                        omitted, .0 is presumed. X must be present.
                        Unspecified defaults are derived from the HTML
                        version. For a list of possible values, use
                        --ontology.list.

                        At the time of writing, the following ontology
                        versions can be verified. Note that single
                        version ontologies cannot have their version
                        changed:

                        The various Adobe ontologies (crs, pdf,
                        photoshop, stdim, stevt, stfnt, stjob, stref,
                        stver, smp, xmpdm, xmpg, xmpgimg, xmpidq,
                        xmpmm, xmprights, xmptpg) have only been
                        partially applied. They do not seem to have
                        been designed for microdata, hence the partial
                        implementation: the goal is to enable hoovering
                        to JSON.

                        BFO (Basic Format Ontology) versions should be
                        specified as follows:
                                Use         For
                                2.0         2.0
                                2.2         2020

                        BFO 2020 uses OBO's machine code style
                        identifiers. Given the history of computing
                        science, as a convenience for users, and with
                        my experience of both devops and maintaining
                        code, identifiers following the standard
                        ontology naming convention are also accepted.
                        Since this is unofficial, both standard English
                        and American dialects' spellings are processed.

                        The Exif & ExifEx ontologies have the following
                        versions:
                            Use     For
                            1.0     1.0 (exif only)

                        Manufacturers' extensions to EXIF are omitted,
                        with exceptions.

                        Open Graph versions correspond to snapshots of
                        the specs from 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018 & 2022.

                        The various Prism ontologies (pam, pamp, pcm,
                        pcmm, pcv, pim, pmi, prism, prism_ad, prl, prm,
                        prs, psv, pur) have only been partially
                        applied: some specifications are unavailable,
                        some specifications break HTML5 syntax. Prism
                        was not designed for microdata, hence the
                        partial implementation: the goal is to enable
                        hoovering to JSON.

                        Most versions of schema (schema.org) should be
                        specified by their version number, but this
                        doesn't work with early versions, which should
                        be specified a follows:

                        vCard versions correspond to RDFa specs,
                        published in 2001, 2006, 2010 & 2014. They do
                        NOT correspond to vCard data format
                        specifications.

--shadow.changed        When shadowing a site that has been previously
                        shadowed, only copy/link files that have
                        changed.

--shadow.comment        Do not delete comments when writing shadow
                        pages.

--shadow.copy X         Create a shadow directory structure from source
                        HTML files, with errors removed and some things
                        tidied up. X can be:
                                no     copy nothing (default)
                                pages  write 'fixed' source files,
                                       ignore non source files
                                hard   set up hard links to non-source
                                       files (requires source and
                                       shadow directories to be on the
                                       same disk) (see below)
                                soft   set up soft links to non-source
                                       files (see below)
                                all    copy non HTML files too
                                dedu   copy non HTML files too, but
                                       deduplicate them, changing links
                                       in HTML source if necessary (see
                                       below)
                                report report duplicates (no
                                       shadowing)
                        ssc cannot convert between versions of HTML,
                        nor between HTML and XHTML.
                        Link options are only available on systems that
                        support links.

--shadow.enable         Enable shadowing (set by other shadow options).
                        If shadowing is enabled, but shadow.root is not
                        set, SSC will litter the site source
                        directories with .ndx files.

--shadow.file f         Write ssc's shadow cache to file f, to
                        accelerate future shadowing of the same
                        content updated.

--shadow.ignore ext     When shadowing, ignore files with this
                        extension (may be repeated).

--shadow.info           Add a comment at or near the top of each
                        shadowed HTML file noting its generation time.

--shadow.msg text       Insert a comment containing text at the top of
                        each generated page. Note that, if any SSI
                        include file is updated, the comment will
                        appear whether or not the original page has
                        changed.

--shadow.root dir       Where to write the shadowed site.

--shadow.space          Leave excess/repeated spaces and blank lines in
                        the shadowed files untidily untouched.

--shadow.ssi            Do NOT resolve Server Side Includes when
                        shadowing, even if --general.ssi is set.

--shadow.update         Only examine files that have changed since the
-u                      last time ssc ran. This is incompatible with
                        --corpus.file. This requires --shadow.file.
                        Nits of files that have not changed will not be
                        reported.

--shadow.virtual v=d    When shadowing virtual directories, output the
                        shadow of virtual directory 'v' to directory
                        'd'. 'v' must match a directory set up using
                        --site.virtual.

--site.domain domain    The domain name of the site is 'domain'. This
-S domain               can be repeated. This is used to identify any
                        URL that is apparently external but is actually
                        internal to the site.

--site.extension ext    Treat files with this extension as X/HTML
-x ext                  source files. This may be repeated. Files with
                        extension .html are always checked.

--site.index file       This is the name of the default file in a
-i file                 directory. This can be repeated. This is used
                        for checking internal links.

--site.root dir         This is the root of the website to analyse. ssc
-g dir                  will recursively scan the directory analysing
                        any HTML files it finds. The default is the
                        current directory.

--site.virtual v=d      The virtual directory 'v' is located in actual
-L v=d                  directory 'd' on the local filesystem. For
                        example:
                            --site.virtual virtual=D:\actual

--spell.accept XXX      XXX is a correct spelling of a word (or a list
                        of words) in all languages.

--spell.cased           Nitpick correctly spelt but wrongly cased
                        words.

--spell.check           Check text spelling. Uses external spelling
                        checkers, so results will be inconsistent
                        between systems.

--spell.dict LANG,DICT  Unix only. Associate dictionary DICT with LANG.
                        For example, if the standard English dictionary
                        is en_GB-large:
                            --spell.dict en-GB,en_GB-large
                        (Under Windows, ssc uses the OS dictionaries.)

--spell.icu             If "no", do not use the ICU libraries at all
                        (they are rather slow). This will increase the
                        inaccuracy and incorrectness of the spell checks.

--spell.list FN,LANG    The file FN contains a list of valid spellings
                        for language LANG (which may include country
                        info). If LANG is omitted, the valid spellings
                        apply to all languages. For example:
                            --spell.list villages.txt,en-IE
                            --spell.list dorfer.txt,de
                            --spell.list letzstied.txt

--spell.path PATH       Unix only. Path to spelling executable.
                        Hunspell or a compatible program is expected.
                        If none is specified, ssc will seek hunspell.
                        (Under Windows, ssc uses the OS spellchecker.)

--stats.export F        Export stats to file F.

--stats.meta            Produce statistics on <META> usage in <HEAD>.
                        Note that pragmas reported (http-equiv) are
                        those found in the HTML source, not those
                        returned by the HTTP protocol. Remember that
                        many web servers (not all) will remove some
                        pragmas when serving pages.

--stats.page            Produce statistics for each source file
                        encountered.

--stats.summary         Produce a summary of overall statistics for the
                        website.

--svg.version x         Presume any SVG code encountered is this
                        version, unless the SVG code itself specifies a
                        version. Versions recognised:
                            1.0
                            1.1

                            1.2/full (May 2004 draft, incomplete, any
                                      conflict with 1.2/tiny always

                        If this switch is not used, and some SVG code
                        does not identify its version, the version is
                        derived from the version of the host X/HTML
                        code.

--validation.attribute ATT

                        are 0, 1, 2, and 3 (draft). WhatWG versions are
                        determined by date, corresponding roughly to
                        the date of the (online) publication of the

--validation.XXX YYY    Accept YYY as a valid value for attribute type
                        XXX. For a list of possible values of XXX, use
                        the command line switch --validation.



CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

If a configuration file is used, it should be in INI file format. All
content is optional.

Section and option names are derived from the long form switch name,
which consists of --SECTION.OPTION, laid out in the format:

[SECTION]
OPTION=yes
OPTION=123456

Switches that do not have a long form version cannot be used in a
configuration file.

Each ssc test (in the recipe/toast folder) has a configuration file;
browse them for examples.



ENVIRONMENT

If you set --general.cgi, ssc will check these environment variables:

QUERY_STRING            Run under OpenBSD's httpd server. See notes
                        below.
SSC_CONFIG              If no configuration file is given on the
                        command line, use this one
SSC_ARGS                Preliminary command line parameters

If, when SSC is run, the environment variable QUERY_STRING is set to an
OpenBSD httpd server CGI value that includes the parameter
html.snippet, then SSC will nitpick that snippet only. Some other
parameters are processed, including general.verbose and html.version.



EXIT STATUS

If no significant nits are found, ssc exits with 0, otherwise it exits
with a value > 0. See the --general.error switch.



OUTPUT TEMPLATE

The --nit.format switch allows control of output format. It takes a
file name. The format of that text file is a sequence of fixed section
names, enclosed in square brackets on their own lines, each optionally
followed by text. In that text, certain specific identifiers, enclosed
in brace pairs, are substituted. For example:

[dog-section]
My pet dog {{dog-name}} is a {{bad-dog}}.

For examples, browse recipe/toast/output/*.nit

If no file is specified, or if the file cannot be loaded, a default
template is used.

Note also the --nit.quote switch.



EXAMPLES

To verify the version of ssc:
ssc -V

To check the static web side source directory /home/site/wwwroot:
ssc /home/site/wwwroot

To check a static HTML/XHTML website for example.com, that uses server
side includes, in the current directory, with verification of external
links, with rather verbose output:
ssc -e -I -x html -x shtml -s example.com -v 5 -i index.shtml

To check a static web side in the current directory, with a virtual
directory, verifying microformats:
ssc -L vitual=/home/site/virtual -M

To check a static web site using a configuration file:
ssc -f config.file

A simple configuration file might contain:

[general]
verbose=4
output=simple.out
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=simple

A configuration file to check a site against HTML 5.2 and SVG 1.1 might
contain:

[general]
output=site.out
class=yes
[link]
check=yes
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=site
[html]
version=5.2
[svg]
version=1.1

A configuration file to check against a particular WhatWG living
standard, gathering statistics:

[general]
output=jan21.out
[html]
version=2021/01/01
[link]
check=yes
[microdata]
version=11.0
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=site
[stats]
summary=yes
meta=yes

A configuration file to shadow copy and deduplicate a site might
contain:

[general]
output=dedu.out
class=yes
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=site
[shadow]
copy=5
root=shadow
file=dedu.ndx

A configuration file to export microdata preparing against schema.org
version 7.2 might contain:

[general]
output=export.out
class=yes
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=site
[link]
check=yes
[microdata]
export=yes
root=export
version=7.2



PREPARING and UPDATING a SITE

These files are based on the steps I take to update an OpenBSD website.

Presume a directory containing the following:
site.conf    ssc configuration file for a website
site         shadow output produced by ssc

Then I run a script like this:

ssc -f site.conf
upload.sh site /var/www/site-upload server user 0
ssh user@server "cd /var/www ; mv site x ; mv site-upload site ;
mv x site-upload ; ln -sf site htdocs"

upload.sh is a macos bash script that can be found among the source
code. Note that I have rather naughtily replaced OpenBSD's httpd
document directory /var/www/htdocs with a link.

Here is site.conf:

[general]
verbose=4
class=yes
output=site.out
ssi=yes
ignore=pre
rpt=yes

[html]
version=2021/04/01

[link]
check=yes
xlink=yes

[microformat]
verify=yes

[site]
domain=example.com
extension=html
extension=shtml
index=index.shtml
root=corrupt_source

[stats]
summary=yes

[shadow]
copy=dedu
root=site
file=site.ndx
ignore=inc
info=yes
