<h1>Introduction to HTML+</h1>

<ABSTRACT>A proposed standard for a light weight delivery format for
	browsing and querying information in a web of globally distributed
	hypertext accessible over the Internet

<P ID="p1">The P element acts as container for the text between the start
tag &lt;P&gt;*1 and end tag &lt;/P&gt;. You don't need to give the end
tag as it is implied by the context, e.g. the following &lt;P&gt; tag.
<P ID="p2">If you wish, you may think of the &lt;P&gt; tag as a paragraph
separator. This works since HTML+ formally doesn't require you to wrap
text up as paragraphs.

<p><img align=top src="../x.jpg"> Before
coming to CERN, Tim worked on, among other things, document production
and text processing. He developed his first hypertext system,
"Enquire",in 1980 for his own use (although unaware of the existence
of the term HyperText). With a background in text processing,
real-time software and communications, Tim decided that high energy
physics needed a networked hypertext system and CERN was an ideal
site for the development of wide-area hypertext ideas. Tim started
the WorldWideWeb project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the application on
the NeXT along with most of the communications software.

<QUOTE>The next five years will see a revolution in computing. Users
will no longer have to work at every computer task as if they had no
need or ability to share data with all their other computer tasks,
they will not need to act as if the computer is simply a replacement
for paper, nor will they have to appease computers or software
programs that seem to be at war with one another.</QUOTE>

<DD>I myself heard the King say he would not be ransomed.
<DT>Williams
<DD>Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but when our
throats are cut he may be ransomed, and we none the wiser.
<DT>King Henry
<DD>If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
<DT>Williams
<DD>You pay him then! That's a perilous shot out of an elder-gun,
that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch!
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice, with fanning in
his face with a peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
after! Come `tis a foolish saying.

From Oberon in fairyland,
   The king of ghosts and shadows there,
Mad Robin I, at his command,
   Am sent to view the night sports here.
      What revel rout
      Is kept about,
   In every corner where I go,
      I will o'ersee
      And merry be
   And make good sport, with ho, ho, ho!
