ssc analyses static X/HTML snippets, files and sites:
- HTML 1.0/+/2.0/3.0/3.2/4.00/4.01/5.0/5.1/5.2/5.3-draft
- HTML living standard, Jan 2005 to Jul 2022
- SVG 1.0/1.1/1.2 Tiny/1.2 Full/2.0/2.x draft Apr 2021
- MathML 1/2/3/4 draft Jul 2022
- XHTML 1.0/1.1/2.0/5.x
- finds broken links
- server side includes, mostly
- common microdata & RDFa ontologies

with opinions on:
- standard english where dialect is required
- perfectly legal but sloppy HTML
- abhorrent rudeness such as autoplay on videos

It does NOT:
- analyse or understand scripts
- analyse or understand styles, beyond nicking class names from CSS
- analyse or understand XML or derivatives, except as noted above

It can output:
- 'repaired' HTML (not XHTML)
- HTML with resolved server side includes
- JSONs of ontological content
- website statistical information
- deduplicated websites



ssc -h

ssc -f config_file

To build & run:
1. Follow the build instructions in build.txt
2. Gleefully run ssc. It will misbehave if you are insufficiently
   gleeful.

- copy of pages/website being analysed;
- precise command used;

- any ndx file or other pre-existing file used during the run;
- any known workarounds or solutions;
- a blues or dance interpretation of the 'feature';
and emailing everything to mail@ssc.lu (if the collected files are more
than small, please use a public fileserver and email the link). Do NOT
send anything confidential. Furthermore, unless you request otherwise,
we reserve the right to publish some or all of the information sent in

SSC can be run in a CGI environment. This is intended for use with
OpenBSD's native httpd web server (https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8).
You are reminded that SSC is pre-production software. Do NOT expose it
to untrusted data sources, such as the open web, without taking
precautions.



Notes on names:
- recipe: a nod to Vernor Vinge's "A Fire Upon the Deep";
- tea: without tea, nothing works; then there's builders' tea;
- sauce: identifies those who presume; and anyway, it's obvious;
- toast: toasts code; i like burnt toast;
- heater: i'm not stopping now;
- unii: my preferred plural of unix: to my ears, both unixes and unices
  sound like they sing castrato.

Background
I have a website, arts & ego, at https://dylanharris.org/. It has
approaching 60G of original content. It contains hand coded HTMLs 2,
3, 4 & 5. It is a complete mess. Despite a long search, I could not
find any tools to properly diagnose its flaws. Anything I did find
was at most cursory.

Then came the cow flu*.

* corvid means crow, thus covid means cow**.

** by the rules of sympathetic spelling.
