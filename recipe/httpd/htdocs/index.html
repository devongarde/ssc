<h2>introduction</h2>

<P>
The static site checker is an opinionated HTML nitpicker, a command&ndash;line tool to validate static HTML &amp; XHTML websites.
I built it to nitpick my hand&ndash;coded
<A href="https://dylanharris.org/">identity website</A>.
</P>

<P>
It should not be used on untrusted content; its parsers are holier than <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Holy...%22">Robin&rsquo;s cow</A>.
</P>

<P>
If you want to try it, play with the form below, or, if you&rsquo;re really enthusiastic,
<a href="src/ssc-v0.1.2.tgz" type="application/gzip">here&rsquo;s the current source</a>.

<h3>note</h3>

<P>
SSC is a <em>site</em> checker, not a page checker, yet here you can only input a page, at most.
It is not the best possible illustration of the program&rsquo;s abilities, but it is better than nothing.
Testing a web site would require proof of control of that site, and I&rsquo;m not going there for a simple demo.
</p>

<P>
Not all features are available. For example, spell checking and link checking are disabled.
There is a fairly tight limit on the size of a snippet.
</p>

<P>
SSC is &alpha; software. This form demos of its potential, that&rsquo;s all.
Do not presume reported issues are correct. Do not presume unreported issues aren&rsquo;t issues.
If you&rsquo;re unsure, check against the appropriate standard. There is no guarantee of anything, let alone accuracy.
</P>

<section id="why">
<h2>why SSC</h2>

<p>
Why did I make the static site checker? Aren&rsquo;t there a lot of other HTML validators around?
When I checked a few years ago; I couldn&rsquo;t find a web site validator, only web page validators.
Things may have improved. Anyway, my google fu is poo.
</p>

<p>
My <a href="https://dylanharris.org/">identity website</a> has more than 100,000 pages. I&rsquo;m too impatient
to push each through a validator one by one; I want to validate my site as a whole.
Furthermore, single page validators can&rsquo;t catch inter&ndash;page errors, such as
broken internal links, let alone hidden links
(an otherwise valid link to a HIDDEN element).
</p>

<p>
Many people avoid such problems by using frameworks.
I find frameworks awful. IMAO, they produce dull, boring, trite design.
The visual arts world has had centuries to develop excellent form for a rectangular space.
Most 21<sup>st</sup> frameworks are so crude they haven&rsquo;t even absorbed 14<sup>th</sup> century visual arts&rsquo; ideas,
when painters broke out of rectangular form in a rectangular frame.
So much is possible, so much hasn&rsquo;t happened.
I want to break this dull, stultifying, archaic, conservatism.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I&rsquo;m making the wrong comparison, that the web isn&rsquo;t about image, it&rsquo;s about type.
The Western visual arts never did really suss mixing writing and form
(that&rsquo;s not really true, but, IMAO, such arts never escaped their context).
However, the Eastern visual arts most certainly did, and frameworks haven&rsquo;t noticed them either.
</p>

<p>
Enough of this. Rather than criticising other people for not doing, I should do. 
I need to make some example sites. That&rsquo;s where SSC comes in.
</p>

<p>
If I am to build a site using an experimental visual process, I can&rsquo;t use frameworks.
If I can&rsquo;t use frameworks, I have to hand code.
And there&rsquo;s the key problem: HTML is such a convoluted, evolved mess,
that the people who designed it, in their own design presentations, make errors.
Ok, I only found this out by testing SSC on them,
which conveniently illustrates that HTML is overcomplicated.
I&rsquo;m not going
to reveal names because these people are working hard to make the web a better place.
Let&rsquo;s just say <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3</a> had broken links,
<a href="https://whatwg.org/">WhatWG</a> referenced withdrawn ontologies,
and many other authors&rsquo; sites have other internal inconsistencies.
That the people who define the web make mistakes using their own design in their own documents that
espouse their design, helps explain why most stick to dull, formulaic, boring, frameworks.
To be fair, my HTML code is far worse than any of these mild examples of technical naughtiness.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve yet to build a site inspired by visual art&rsquo;s form and layout.
My efforts have been spent building SSC, a tool to make that practical.
</p>

<p>
Since I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;ll list other issues I have with frameworks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
They have to be regularly maintained. Every time an update comes out, that update has to be applied to a site,
or the site becomes vulnerable to the exploits published by the update.
Time is lost playing patch catchup.
</li>
<li>
Updates for frameworks sometimes fail;
instead of fixing issues, they break sites.
That&rsquo;s why <a href="https://dylanharris.org/past/aei/2010/index.html">I dropped Drupal</a>.
That&rsquo;s why I swore off NextCloud.
</li>
<li>
Frameworks use scripted languages, such as PHP.
There were, in October 2021,
<A href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/128/PHP-PHP.html?vendor_id=74">five known vulnerabilities in PHP</a>
(far better than time was).
Other frameworks use other scripted languages with other problems.
</li>
<li>
IMAO, frameworks&rsquo; and scripts&rsquo; worst flaw is many import code at runtime from
third&ndash;party repositories.
Their integrity and security is dependent on that of the repository,
over which a site owner (usually) has no control.
There are many examples of
<a href="https://www.theallineed.com/technology/20210330/php-source-code-repository-hacked/">repositories being hacked</a>,
breaking the security and intergrity of all sites that use them.
</li>
</ul>

To build &amp; run:
1. Follow the build instructions in build.txt
2. Gleefully run ssc. It will misbehave if you are insufficiently gleeful.



This is an &alpha; version of ssc. Despite heavy testing, it may contain
unexpected features. If you encounter such an bug, please help improve
ssc by collecting the following information (where relevant):
- version of ssc;
- precise version of the operating system;
- hardware architecture and system information;
- detailed description of the error and how to cause it;
- copy of output file showing the error;
- copy of pages/website being analysed;
- precise command used;
- configuration file(s) used, if any;
- any ndx file or other pre&ndash;existing file used during the run;
- any known workarounds or solutions;
- a blues or dance interpretation of the &lsquo;feature&rsquo;;
and emailing everything to mail@ssc.lu (if the collected files are more
than small, please use a public fileserver and email the link). Do NOT
send anything confidential. Furthermore, unless you request otherwise,
we reserve the right to publish some or all of the information sent in
future versions of ssc, usually in the test suite. If you have a fix,
you are invited to submit a pull request on github. Thank you.



SSC can be run in a CGI environment. This is intended for use with OpenBSD&rsquo;s native httpd web server
(https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8). You are reminded that SSC is &alpha; software. Do NOT expose it
to untrusted data sources, such as the open web, without taking serious precautions. SSC probably has
more bugs than the Creator&rsquo;s Ultimate All&ndash;Beetle Extravaganza (J.B.S. Haldane, apocryphal : &ldquo;[the
Creator has] an inordinate fondness for beetles.&rdquo;).



Notes on names:
- recipe: a nod to Vernor Vinge&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Fire Upon the Deep&rdquo;
- tea: without tea, nothing works; then there&rsquo;s builders&rsquo; tea
- sauce: identifies those who presume; and anyway, it&rsquo;s obvious
- toast: toasts code; i like burnt toast
- heater: i&rsquo;m not stopping now
- unii: my preferred plural of unix; both unixes and unices sound like they sing castrato

NAME
ssc - analyse static web site source



SYNOPSIS
ssc [...] directory
ssc -f config
ssc



DESCRIPTION
ssc (the Static Site Checker) is an opinionated HTML nit-picker, intended for
people, such as its author, who hand code websites. It doesn't just check
static websites for broken links, dubious syntax, and bad semantic data, it
will actively complain about things that are perfectly legal but just a little
bit untidy, like its author.

Except when serving CGI queries, it recursively scans the directory looking
for HTML source files to analyse. It produces a list of errors, warnings,
comments, and other hints of imperfection. Once complete, it summarises
internal site inconsistencies, and can produce some simple statistics.

Scripts are ignored. CSS is only processed for class declarations.



COMMAND LINE ONLY SWITCHES

These options are only available on the command line:

-f file                 Load configuration from file, which should be in .INI
                        file format. See CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT below.

-F                      Load the configuration file .ssc/config in the current
                        directory.

-h                      Show a summary of switches, then exit.

-H snippet              Only nitpick this snippet of html

--ontology.list         List known schema versions, then exit.

-V                      Show version details, then exit.

--validation            Show attribute extensions, then exit. Attribute
                        extensions are additional values that can be
                        associated with attributes on some X/HTML elements,
                        and is intended for use with bespoke extensions of
                        HTML.



COMMAND LINE AND CONFIGURATION FILES SWITCHES

These options are available on the command line (with dashes) and in
configuration files (without dashes). The short form alternative switches
only work on the command line.

Most binary options, e.g. those without arguments below that turn on a feature
(which may be the default), have a corresponding "no-" switch to turn it off.
The "no-" is inserted after the dot, so, for example, the contradiction to
"--general.class" is "--general.no-class". When both are specified, perhaps in
a configuration file and on the command line, the "no-" switch always applies.

--corpus.article        Prefer the content of &lt;ARTICLE&gt; when gathering corpus
                        text.

--corpus.body           Prefer the content of &lt;BODY&gt; when gathering corpus
                        text. This is the default.

--corpus.main           Prefer the content of &lt;MAIN&gt; when gathering corpus
                        text.

--corpus.output file    Dump XML corpus of site into file. This is intended
                        for use by a local search engine. If none of
                        --corpus.article, --corpus.body, or --corpus.main are
                        specified, the content of &lt;BODY&gt; is used. If more than
                        one are specified, then the text collected depends on
                        a page's content. This is incompatible with
                        --shadow.update.

--general.class         Report unrecognised classes.

--general.classic       Report all classes used.

--general.cgi           Check environment variables for snippets of HTML.
-W                      Expects environment variables as produced by
                        OpenBSD's native web server, httpd, produced
                        using &lt;FORM METHOD=GET &hellip;&gt;. Do NOT let ssc
                        anywhere near untrusted data should you do so,
                        unless you are very confident about your system
                        configuration (because it'll defend you against
                        naughty people who may take advantage of ssc's
                        pre-alpha nature and its corresponding myriad
                        flaws). Ignores many options including shadowing.

--general.css           Do NOT process .css files (for class names).

--general.custom EL     Define a custom element &lt;EL&gt; for verifying the IS
                        attribute. May be repeated.

--general.datapath dir  Look for any configuration, caches, and other useful
-p dir                  files, in this directory.

--general.error x       If nits of the specified category or worse are
-E                      generated, then exit with an error code. Values are:
                        'catastrophe', 'error' (the default), 'warning',
                        'info', or 'comment'.

--general.exclude REG   Ignore all files that match the posix regular
                        expression REG. May be repeated.

--general.file XXX      File for persistent data. Requires -N. See also
                        --general.datapath. Default extension: .ndx.

--general.git           Ignore internal git files

--general.ignore EL     ignore attributes and content of the element &lt;EL&gt;. May
                        be repeated.

--general.info          Report launch context when starting

--general.lang LA       If an X/HTML file does not have a language / dialect
                        specified (e.g. "en" for generic English, "en-IE" for
                        Irish English, "lb-LU" for Luxembourgish, etc.),
                        default to 'LA'. If not given, the default is your
                        system default, or, if none, then "en-US" (standard
                        American English).

--general.maxfilesize n Do not process HTML source files that exceed n bytes
                        in size (default: 4M). Specify 0 for unlimited,
                        although be warned that ssc is stunningly stupid in
                        such circumstances and may even attempt to load files
                        bigger than available memory.

--general.output        Output to the specified file. If this switch is not
-o file                 used, standard output is used.

--general.progress      Dump progress information to standard output. This can
-D                      interfere with formatted output.

--general.rdfa          Check RDFa attributes.

--general.rel           Only mention &lt;LINK&gt; REL values, found neither in the
                        living standard nor at microformats.org, in debug
                        output.

--general.rpt           Report CSS files that are opened. ssc opens CSS files
                        to verify classes; it does not verify CSS.

--general.slob          Ignore perfectly legal but inefficient, indeed
                        thoroughly slobby, HTML, such as being far too lazy to
                        get round to bothering to close elements.

--general.spec          Reset the values of most switches to false
-j

--general.ssi           Process Server Side Includes. Although ssc can process
-I                      many server side includes, it cannot process those
                        containing formulae. Note that processing SSIs may
                        cause incorrect line numbers to be mentioned when an
                        issue is reported.

--general.test          Output data in automated test format. Used by ssc-test.
-T                      Not generally useful. Documented so you can avoid it!

--general.thread N      Use N threads when running. Defaults to a value
                        appropriate for the hardware. Too high a value can
                        cause problems.

--general.verbose x     Output nits to the specified verbosity: 'catastrophe',
-v                      'error', 'warning', 'info', 'comment' (the default),
                        or '0' for silence. Additional values are available
                        when debugging. Each level includes its preceding
                        level, so, for example, 'warning' will also output
                        'catastrophe' and 'error' nits.

--html.rfc1867          Ignore the RFC 1867 (INPUT=FILE) extension when
                        processing HTML 2.0

--html.rfc1942          Ignore the RFC 1942 (tables) extension when processing
                        HTML 2.0.

--html.rfc1980          Ignore the RFC 1980 (client side image maps) extension
                        when processing HTML 2.0.

--html.rfc2070          Ignore the RFC 2070 (internationalisation) extension
                        when processing HTML 2.0.

--html.tags             When an HTML file is loaded that contains no DOCTYPE,
                        ssc normally presumes it's an HTML 1 file. This switch
                        tells it to presume the file follows an earlier HTML
                        Tags specification (the one at CERN). This is
                        overridden by --html.version.

--html.title n          If &lt;TITLE&gt; text is longer than n characters, say so.
-z n                    This applies to text enclosed by a &lt;TITLE&gt; element in
                        under &lt;HEAD&gt;, not the value of TITLE attributes.

--html.version X        If no doctype (or xml header) is specified, presume
                        version X of HTML. X can be:
                            tags        HTML tags (1991, informal),
                            1.0         HTML 1.0 (June 1993 draft),

                                        HTML.

                        Although you can specify exact dates for versions of
                        the WhatWG HTML 5 living standard, currently only
                        broad versions published in January and July are
                        supported (quarterly from 2021).

                        Certain versions of HTML offer variants, such as loose
                        and strict definitions. ssc picks those up from the
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE &hellip;&gt; in the HTML file, if any, and then
                        carefully ignores them.

                        Validation of XHTML is even less strict.

                        Just to remind you, there are no guarantees of
                        accuracy (or inaccuracy).

                        Copies of the appropriate standards can be found
                        online. A copy of the copies referenced during ssc's
                        development can be found at https://ssc.lu/.

--link.301              Normally, when ssc checks external links
-3                      (--link.external), it does not report http forwarding
                        errors 301 and 308. Use this switch to have it do so.

--link.check            Check internal links, e.g. those within the website
-l                      being analysed.

--link.example          Report links to faux domains, as defined by RFC 2606
                        (note ssc also reports links to example.edu).

--link.external         Check external links, e.g. those not on the site being
-e                      checked. Note that ssc will NOT check RFC 2606 links,
                        such as example.com (see --link.example).

--link.forward          Report HTTP forwarding errors encountered when checking
                        external links (e.g. 301 and 308)

--link.ignore DOMAIN    When checking external links, ignore this domain. May
                        be repeated.

--link.local            Report links to local domains, such as domains ending
                        in .lan, .home, .corp, and others.

--link.once             Only report each broken external link once. If, for
-O                      example, the site has a number of references to a page
                        that does not exist, ssc will only report the first
                        instance of the broken link. Note that, even if it
                        reports every occurrence of the link, it will only
                        check it the first time it's encountered (requires
                        --link.external).

--link.report DOMAIN    Report links to domain and its descendents. May be
                        repeated.

--link.revoke           Do not check whether links' https certificates have
-r                      been revoked (requires --link.external).

--link.xlink            Check crosslink IDs on the site being analysed. For
-X                      example, if a link goes to /index.html#id, then, when
                        this switch is set, ssc will verify that the id exists
                        and that it is not hidden.

--math.version          Presume this version of MathML (1, 2 or 3). The
                        following versions are supported:
                                0   work it out from the (HTML) version of the
                                    file being analysed,
                                1   MathML 1,
                                2   MathML 2,
                                3   MathML 3,
                                4   MathML 4 (December 2020 draft).

--microdata.export      Export schema.org microdata encountered. This data is
                        exported in JSON format (not JSON-LD).

--microdata.root DIR    When exporting microdata with --microdata.export,
                        write files into the directory DIR. ssc will create
                        the directory tree structure as appropriate.

--microdata.verify      Check microdata found in WhatWG microdata attributes
-m                      (itemprop, itemtype, etc.). Note that ssc only knows
                        about certain ontologies (see --ontology.list)

--microdata.virtual v=d When exporting microdata using --microdata.export,
                        export the contents of virtual directory 'v' to 'd'.
                        'v' must match a directory identified with
                        --site.virtual. For example:
                            --microdata.virtual virtual=X:\virtual.

--microformat.export    Export microformat data encountered in JSON format.
                        This option will write files in the same directory as
                        the source, with the extension .json.

--microformat.verify    Verify Microformats data in class and rel attributes
-M                      (see https://microformats.org/).

--microformat.version x Presume microformats version x. The following values
                        are current accepted:
                                1   microformats version 1 only,
                                2   microformats version 2 only,
                                3   both microformats versions 1 and 2.

--nits.catastrophe n    redefine nit n as a catastrophe; may be repeated (the
                        value of n can be determined using --nits.nids below).

--nits.comment n        Redefine nit n as a comment; may be repeated (the
                        value of n can be determined using --nits.nids).

--nits.debug n          Redefine nit n as a debug message; may be repeated
                        (the value of n can be determined using --nits.nids).

--nits.error n          Redefine nit n as an error; may be repeated (the
                        value of n can be determined using --nits.nids).

--nits.format F         Specify the output format; F is a template file (see
                        OUTPUT TEMPLATE below).

--nits.info n           Redefine nit n as information; may be repeated (the
                        value of n can be determined using --nits.nids).

--nits.nids             Output nit ids, which can be used to redefine nits.

--nits.override F       Use this output format, not the one specified by
                        --nits.format. F is a template file (see OUTPUT
                        TEMPLATE below). This switch is intended to aid
                        automation.

--nits.quote X          Specify quote style when using nit.format. X can be
                        one of 'text' or 'html'.

--nits.root             By default, seek nit output template files in the
                        website root.

--nits.silence n        Silence nit n; may be repeated (the value of n can be
                        determined using --nits.nids).

--nits.unique           Do not output repeated nits, even if they may contain
                        additional information.

--nits.warning n        Redefine nit n as a warning; may be repeated (the
                        value of n can be determined using --nits.nids).

--nits.watch            Output debug nits (intended for automation).

--rdfa.version          When checking RDFa files, presume this version
                        (default: 1.1.3). Note, RDFa analyis is incomplete,
                        and only intended for supporting HTML analysis.

--ontology.ONT X.Y      Presume version X.Y of ontology ONT. For example:
                            --ontology.xsd 1.1
                        defaults usage of XSD to version 1.1. The versions
                        apply to RDFa, microdata, and microformats (using
                        class) analysis. If .Y is omitted, .0 is presumed.
                        X must be present. Unspecified defaults are
                        derived from the HTML version. For a list of
                        possible values, use --ontology.list.

                        At the time of writing, the following ontology
                        versions can be verified. Note that single version
                        ontologies cannot have their version changed:

--shadow.changed        When shadowing a site that has been previously
                        shadowed, only copy/link files that have changed.

--shadow.comment        Do not delete comments when writing shadow pages.

--shadow.copy X         Create a shadow directory structure from source HTML
                        files, with errors removed and some things tidied up.
                        X can be:
                                no     copy nothing (default);
                                pages  write 'fixed' source files, ignore non
                                       source files;
                                hard   set up hard links to non-source files
                                       (requires source and shadow directories
                                       to be on the same disk);
                                soft   set up soft links to non-source files;
                                all    copy non HTML files too;
                                dedu   copy non HTML files too, but
                                       deduplicate them, changing links in
                                       HTML source if necessary;
                                report report duplicates (no shadowing).
                        ssc cannot convert between versions of HTML, nor
                        between HTML and XHTML. The soft and hard link options
                        are only available on systems that support them.

--shadow.enable         Enable shadowing (set by other shadow options). If
                        shadowing is enabled, but shadow.root is not set, SSC
                        will litter the site source directories with .ndx
                        files.

--shadow.file f         Write ssc's shadow cache to file f, to accelerate
                        future shadowing of the same content.

--shadow.ignore ext     When shadowing, ignore files with this extension (may
                        be repeated).

--shadow.info           Add a comment at or near the top of each shadowed HTML
                        file noting its generation time.

--shadow.msg text       Insert a comment containing the text at the top of
                        every generated page. Note that, if any SSI included
                        file is updated, the comment will appear whether or
                        not the original page is updated.

--shadow.root dir       Where to write the shadowed site.

--shadow.space          Leave excess/repeated spaces and blank lines in the
                        shadowed files untidily untouched.

--shadow.ssi            Do NOT resolve Server Side Includes when shadowing,
                        even if --general.ssi is set.

--shadow.update         Only examine files that have changed since the last
-u                      time ssc ran. This is incompatible with --corpus.file.
                        This requires --shadow.file. Nits of files that have
                        not changed will not be reported.

--shadow.virtual v=d    When shadowing virtual directories, output the shadow
                        of virtual directory 'v' to directory 'd'. 'v' must
                        match a directory set up using --site.virtual.

--site.domain domain    The domain name of the site is 'domain'. This can be
-S domain               repeated. This is used to identify any URL that is
                        apparently external but is actually internal to the
                        site.

--site.extension ext    Treat files with this extension as X/HTML source
-x ext                  files. This may be repeated. Files with extension
                        .html are always checked.

--site.index file       This is the name of the index file in a directory.
-i file                 This can be repeated. This is used for checking
                        internal links.

--site.root dir         This is the root of the website to analyse. ssc will
-g dir                  recursively scan the directory analysing any HTML
                        files it finds. The default is the current directory.

--site.virtual v=d      The virtual directory 'v' is located in actual
-L v=d                  directory 'd' on the local filesystem. For example:
                            --site.virtual virtual=D:\actual

--spell.accept XXX      XXX is a correct spelling or a word (or a list of
                        words) in all languages.

--spell.cased           Nitpick correctly spelt but wrongly cased words.

--spell.check           Check text spelling. Uses external spelling checkers,
                        so results may be inconsistent between systems.

--spell.dict LANG,DICT  Unix only. Associate dictionary DICT with LANG. For
                        example, if the standard English dictionary is
                        en_GB-large:
                            --spell.dict en-GB,en_GB-large
                        (Under Windows, ssc uses the OS dictionaries.)

--spell.icu             If "no", do not use the ICU libraries at all (they are
                        rather slow). This will increase the inaccuracy and
                        incorrectness of the spell checks.

--spell.list FN,LANG    The file FN contains a list of valid spellings for
                        language LANG (which may include country info). If
                        LANG is omitted, the valid spellings apply to all
                        languages. For example:
                            --spell.list villages.txt,en-IE
                            --spell.list dorfer.txt,de
                            --spell.list letzstied.txt

--spell.path PATH       Unix only. Path to spelling executable. Hunspell or
                        a compatible program is expected. If none is specified,
                        ssc will seek hunspell. (Under Windows, ssc uses the
                        OS spellchecker.)

--stats.export F        Export stats to file F.

--stats.meta            Produce statistics on &lt;META&gt; usage in &lt;HEAD&gt;. Note
                        that pragmas reported (http-equiv) are those found in
                        the HTML source, not those returned by the HTTP
                        protocol. Remember that many web servers (not all)
                        will remove some pragmas when serving pages.

--stats.page            Produce statistics for each source file encountered.

--stats.summary         Produce a summary of overall statistics for the
                        website.

--svg.version x         Presume any SVG code encountered is this version,
                        unless the SVG code itself specifies a version.
                        Versions recognised:
                            1.0,
                            1.1,
                            1.2 (really 1.2/tiny),
                            1.2/tiny,
                            1.2/full (May 2004 draft, incomplete, any conflict
                                      with tiny always resolved in favour of
                                      tiny),
                            2.0,
                            2.1 (april 2021 draft).
                        If this switch is not used, and some SVG code does not
                        identify its version, the version is derived from the
                        version of the host X/HTML code.

--validation.attribute ATT
                        Add the custom attribute ATT. This attribute will
                        be ignored, not validated.

                        Accept CUR as a valid currency. May be repeated.

--validation.element EL Accept &lt;EL&gt; as a valid element. This element will be
                        ignored, not validated. May be repeated.

--validation.element-attribute EL,ATT
                        Accept the known attribute ATT on the element &lt;EL&gt;.
                        Doesn't work with namespaces (names containing ':').
                        May be repeated.

--validation.extension EXT
                        Accept the extension EXT as a mimetype file extension.
                        May be repeated.

--validation.httpequiv HEQ
                        Accept HEQ as a valid macro for httpequiv on &lt;META&gt;
                        elements. May be repeated.

--validation.lang LANG  Accept LANG as a valid language code. May be repeated.

--validation.minor x    When validating W3 HTML 5 source code, using this
-m x                    minor version of W3 HTML 5. Valid values are 0, 1, 2,
                        and 3 (draft). WhatWG versions are determined by date,
                        corresponding roughly to the date of the (online)
                        publication of the specific version. See the
                        --html.version switch.

--validation.metaname M
                        Accept M as valid for the NAME attribute of the &lt;META&gt;
                        element. The VALUE will be ignored. May be repeated.

--validation.microdata  Validate (schema.org) microdata.

Section and option names are derived from the long form switch name, which
consists of SECTION.OPTION, laid out in the format:
[SECTION]
OPTION=yes
OPTION=123456

Switches that do not have a long form version cannot be used in a
configuration file.

Each ssc test (in the toast folder) has a configuration file; browse them for
examples.



ENVIRONMENT

If you set --general.cgi, ssc will check these environment variables:

QUERY_STRING            Run under OpenBSD's httpd server. See notes below.
SSC_CONFIG              If no configuration file is given on the command line,
                        use this one
SSC_ARGS                Preliminary command line parameters

If, when SSC is run, the environment variable QUERY_STRING is set to an
OpenBSD httpd server CGI value that includes the parameter html.snippet, then
SSC will nitpick that snippet only. Some other parameters are processed,
including general.verbose and html.version.



EXIT STATUS
If no significant nits are found, ssc exits with 0, otherwise it exits with a
value > 0.



OUTPUT TEMPLATE

The --nit.format switch allows control of output format. It takes a file name.
The format of that text file is a sequence of fixed section names, enclosed in
square brackets on their own lines, each optionally followed by text. In that
text, certain specific identifiers, enclosed in brace pairs, are substituted.
For example:

[dog-section]
My pet dog {{dog-name}} is a {{bad-dog}}.

For examples, browse recipe/toast/output/*.nit

If no file is specified, or if the file cannot be loaded, a default template is
used.

Note also the --nit.quote switch.



EXAMPLES

To verify the version of ssc:
ssc -V

To check the static web side source directory /home/site/wwwroot:
ssc /home/site/wwwroot

To check a static website for example.com which uses server side includes, that
lies in the current directory, with verification of external links, giving
rather verbose output:
ssc -e -I -x html -x shtml -s example.com -v 5 -i index.shtml

To check a static web side in the current directory, with a virtual directory,
verifying microformats:
ssc -L vitual=/home/site/virtual -M

To check a static web site using a configuration file:
ssc -f config.file

A simple configuration file might contain:
[general]
verbose=4
output=simple.out
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=simple

A configuration file to check a site against HTML 5.2 and SVG 1.1 might
contain:
[general]
output=site.out
class=yes
[link]
check=yes
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=site
[html]
version=5.2
[svg]
version=1.1

A configuration file to check against a particular WhatWG living standard,
gathering statistics:
[general]
output=jan21.out
[html]
version=2021/01/01
[link]
check=yes
[microdata]
version=11.0
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=site
[stats]
summary=yes
meta=yes

A configuration file to shadow copy and deduplicate a site might contain:
[general]
output=dedu.out
class=yes
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=site
[shadow]
copy=5
root=shadow
file=dedu.ndx

A configuration file to export microdata preparing against schema.org version
7.2 might contain:
[general]
output=export.out
class=yes
[site]
domain=example.edu
extension=html
index=index.html
root=site
[link]
check=yes
[microdata]
export=yes
root=export
version=7.2



PREPARING and UPDATING a SITE

These files are based on the steps I take to update an OpenBSD website.

Presume a directory containing the following:
site.conf    ssc configuration file for a website
site         shadow output produced by ssc

Then I run a script like this:

ssc -f site.conf
upload.sh site /var/www/site-upload server user 0
ssh user@server "cd /var/www ; mv site x ; mv site-upload site ;
mv x site-upload ; ln -sf site htdocs"

upload.sh is a macos bash script that can be found among the source code. Note
that I have rather naughtily replaced OpenBSD's httpd document directory
/var/www/htdocs with a link.

Here is site.conf:

[general]
verbose=info
class=yes
output=site.out
ssi=yes
ignore=pre
rpt=yes

[html]
version=2021/04/01

[link]
check=yes
xlink=yes

[microformat]
verify=yes

[site]
domain=example.com
extension=html
extension=shtml
index=index.shtml
root=corrupt_source

[stats]
summary=yes

[shadow]
copy=dedu
root=site
file=site.ndx
ignore=inc
info=yes

SSC is &alpha; software. It doesn&rsquo;t do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, and what it&rsquo;s supposed to do is wrong.
</p>

<ul><li>
SSC is built based on my understanding of various standards. My understanding is certainly wrong. I will have misread some text, and misunderstood what I read correctly.
</li><li>
I had to make a number of compromises when building the code. Some checks are incomplete or even entirely missing.

I put my emphasis on standards that are actively followed, and put little effort, beyond the basics, into those that were never properly implemented.

I built an evolving product, reflecting evolving standards: biological evolution made the dodo, linguistic evolution made &lsquo;hippopotamus&rsquo;<SUP>*</SUP>, I made ssc.
</li><li>
The code was built to get something working. In many places, it is horrible. A great deal of refactoring could take place, had I the time.
</li><li>
No attempt was made to write secure code. It should only be run on trusted data. In particular, a great weakness of much software is the parser, and the parsers in SSC were handmade using hopeless optimism and bizarre ideas.

BUILD NOTES
static site checker
https://ssc.lu/
(c) 2020-2023 Dylan Harris


Introduction
============
SSC can be built from various unii using CMake, or with Visual Studios
2017 / 2019 / 2022 under Windows. I have built & tested it under x64 in
selected OSs.


Libraries
=========

Common dependencies
-------------------
You should install boost version 1.75 or better (https://boost.org), a recent
version of the ICU libraries (https://icu-project.org/), & Microsoft's GSL
library (https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL). Most unii have most available as
packages. You can install build and install them yourself if you prefer.

You may need to set these environment variables:
- BOOST: if you're not using your operating system's packaged flavour of boost,
  then set BOOST to your boost source root directory (CMake may welcome
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR & BOOST_INCLUDEDIR being set appropriately);
- ICU_ROOT: similarly, if you're not using your operating system's packaged
  ICU, set ICU_ROOT to your ICU library source root directory;
- GSL: set it to your GSL root directory.


hunspell
--------
Building SSC under unii, including macos, requires a development installation
of hunspell (https://hunspell.github.io/). You may need to set these
environment variables:
- HUNSPELL_INCLUDE to point to the hunspell include directory
- HUNSPELL_LIB to point to the hunspell library directory
- HUNSPELL_VERSION, the actual library name (such as "hunspell-1.7.so")

Once you've got them, navigate to recipe/tea, and run cmake.

winspell
--------
The Windows build, by default, uses the native Windows spellchecker, although,
in multilingual contexts that doesn't work so well, unless you use Windows 11.


Building
========

Windows
-------
To build from Visual Studio, navigate to recipe/tea, open the appropriate .sln
file, then build. Only Visual Studios 2017 / 2019 / 2022, 64 bit, have been
built & tested, for Windows 8.1 & 10.

Unii & mock Unii
----------------
You will need CMake 3.12 or better. From the home ssc directory, compile a
normal release build thus:
cd recipe/tea
cmake .
make
ctest
make install

For a debug build:
cd recipe/tea
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
make
ctest
make install

If everything works correctly, then everything will be built, a series of
tests run, with a final result at the very end saying no failures. Having said
that, given SSC is pre-alpha, don't be too surprised to see some warnings or
some final test errors. Note in particular that complaints about being unable
to find or copy files during testing are not of concern, these come from
scripts that set up or tear down individual tests, and the standard commands
used sometimes complain if they can't find files they're supposed to delete,
which is a bit silly given things are already in the desired state.

The following have been successfully built as x64 amd/intel, although not
always under all versions of ssc:
Linux: Centos 8/9 Streams, Ubuntu Server 20.04/20.10
OpenBSD: 7.0 / 6.9 / 6.8
MacOS: Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, High Sierra

Note: Use clang if possible, gcc takes a wee while.


OpenBSD
-------
I've only tested the amd64 build under 6.8 / 6.9 / 7.0 / 7.1.

The versions of boost and cmake in packages are sufficient. You will need to
increase significantly the available memory setting in login.conf for the
build account, if you have not done so already.

Openbsd 6.8 offers hunspell 1.6, so if you use that version, you will need to
set the HUNSPELL_VERSION environment variable appropriately.
