<p>I also have some <mark>kitten</mark>s who are visiting me

 <h1>She knew</h1>
 <p>Did you notice the subtle joke in the joke on panel 4?</p>
 <blockquote>
 <p class="bubble">I didn't <em>want</em> to believe. <mark>Of course
 on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack.</mark> But I
 couldn't admit it until I saw for myself.</p>

 <p>(Emphasis mine.) I thought that was great. It's so pedantic, yet it
 explains everything neatly.</p>

<h3>Wormhole Physics Introduction</h3>
<p><mark>A wormhole in normal conditions can be held open for a
maximum of just under 39 minutes.</mark> Conditions that can increase
the time include a powerful energy source coupled to one or both of
the gates connecting the wormhole, and a large gravity well (such as a
black hole).</p>
<p><mark>Momentum is preserved across the wormhole. Electromagnetic
radiation can travel in both directions through a wormhole,
but matter cannot.</mark></p>
<p>When a wormhole is created, a vortex normally forms.
<strong>Warning: The vortex caused by the wormhole opening will
annihilate anything in its path.</strong> Vortexes can be avoided when
using sufficiently advanced dialing technology.</p>
<p><mark>An obstruction in a gate will prevent it from accepting a
wormhole connection.</mark></p>
